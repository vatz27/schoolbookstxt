160 MATHEMATICS Algebraic Expressions 10.1  INTRODUCTION We have already come across simple algebraic expressions like x + 3,  y – 5, 4x + 5, 10y – 5 and so on. In Class VI, we have seen how these expressions are useful in formulating puzzles and problems. We have also seen examples of several expressions in the chapter on simple equations. Expressions are a central concept in algebra. This Chapter is devoted to algebraic expressions. When you have studied this Chapter, you will know how algebraic expressions are formed, how they can be combined, how we can find their values and how they can be used. 10.2  HOW ARE EXPRESSIONS FORMED? We now know very well what a variable is. We use letters x, y, l, m, ... etc. to denote variables. A variable can take various values. Its value is not fixed. On the other hand, a constant has a fixed value. Examples of constants are: 4, 100, –17, etc. We combine variables and constants to make algebraic expressions. For this, we use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We have already come across expressions like 4x + 5, 10y – 20. The expression 4x + 5 is obtained from the variable x, first by multiplying x by the constant 4 and then adding the constant 5 to the product. Similarly, 10y – 20 is obtained by first multiplying y by 10 and then subtracting 20 from the product. The above expressions were obtained by combining variables with constants. We can also obtain expressions by combining variables with themselves or with other variables. Look at how the following expressions are obtained: x2, 2y2, 3x2 – 5, xy, 4xy + 7 (i) The expression x2 is obtained by multiplying the variable x by itself; x × x = x2 Just as 4 × 4 is written as 42, we write x × x = x2. It is commonly read as x squared. 2024-25 Chapter  10 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 161 (Later, when you study the chapter ‘Exponents and Powers’ you will realise that x2 may also be read as x raised to the power 2). In the same manner, we can write x × x × x = x3 Commonly, x3 is read as ‘x cubed’. Later, you will realise that x3 may also be read as x raised to the power 3. x, x2, x3, ... are all algebraic expressions obtained from x. (ii) The expression 2y2 is obtained from y: 2y2 = 2 × y × y Here by multiplying y with y we obtain y2 and then we multiply y2 by the constant 2. (iii) In (3x2 – 5) we first obtain x2, and multiply it by 3 to get 3x2. TRY THESE From 3x2, we subtract 5 to finally arrive at 3x2 – 5. Describe how the (iv) In xy, we multiply the variable x with another variable y. Thus, following expressions x × y = xy. are obtained: (v) In 4xy + 7, we first obtain xy, multiply it by 4 to get 4xy and add 7 to 4xy to get the expression. 7xy + 5, x2y, 4x2 – 5x 10.3  TERMS OF AN EXPRESSION We shall now put in a systematic form what we have learnt above about how expressions are formed. For this purpose, we need to understand what terms of an expression and their factors are. Consider the expression (4x + 5). In forming this expression, we first formed 4x separately as a product of 4 and x and then added 5 to it. Similarly consider the expression (3x2 + 7y). Here we first formed 3x2 separately as a product of 3, x and x. We then formed 7y separately as a product of 7 and y. Having formed 3x2 and 7y separately, we added them to get the expression. You will find that the expressions we deal with can always be seen this way. They have parts which are formed separately and then added. Such parts of an expression which are formed separately first and then added are known as terms. Look at the expression (4x2 – 3xy). We say that it has two terms, 4x2 and –3xy. The term 4x2 is a product of 4, x and x, and the term (–3xy) is a product of (–3), x and y. Terms are added to form expressions. Just as the terms 4x and 5 are added to form the expression (4x + 5), the terms 4x2 and (–3xy) are added to give the expression (4x2 – 3xy). This is because 4x2 + (–3xy) = 4x2 – 3xy. Note, the minus sign (–)  is included in the term. In the expression 4x2 –3xy, we took the term as (–3xy) and not as (3xy). That is why we do not need to say that terms are ‘added or subtracted’ to form an expression; just ‘added’ is enough. Factors of a term We saw above that the expression (4x2 – 3xy) consists of two terms 4x2 and –3xy. The term 4x2 is a product of 4, x and x; we say that 4, x and x are the factors of the term 4x2. A term is a product of its factors. The term –3xy is a product of the factors –3, x and y. 2024-25 162 MATHEMATICS We can represent the terms and factors of the terms of an expression conveniently and elegantly by a tree diagram. The tree for the expression (4x2 – 3xy) is as shown in the adjacent figure. Note, in the tree diagram, we have used dotted lines for factors and continuous lines for terms. This is to avoid mixing them. Let us draw a tree diagram for the expression 5xy + 10. The factors are such that they cannot be further factorised. Thus we do not write 5xy as 5 × xy, because xy can be further factorised. Similarly, if x3 were a term, it would be written as x × x × x and not x2 × x. Also, remember that 1 is not taken as a separate factor. Coefficients TRY THESE We have learnt how to write a term as a product of factors. 1. What are the terms in the One of these factors may be numerical and the others algebraic following expressions? (i.e., they contain variables). The numerical factor is said to be Show how the terms are the numerical coefficient or simply the coefficient of the term. formed. Draw a tree diagram It is also said to be the coefficient of the rest of the term (which for each expression: is obviously the product of algebraic factors of the term). Thus 8y + 3x2, 7mn – 4, 2x2 in 5xy, 5 is the coefficient of the term. It is also the coefficient y. of xy. In the term 10xyz, 10 is the coefficient of xyz, in the term 2. Write three expression each –7x2y2, –7 is the coefficient of x2y2. having 4 terms. When the coefficient of a term is +1, it is usually omitted. For example, 1x is written as x; 1 x2y2 is written as x2y2 and so on. Also, the coefficient (–1) is indicated only by the minus sign. Thus (–1) x is written as – x; (–1) x 2 y 2 is written as – x2 y2 and so on. Sometimes, the word ‘coefficient’ is used in a more general way. Thus TRY THESE we say that in the term 5xy, 5 is the coefficient of xy, x is the coefficient of 5y and y is the coefficient of 5x. In 10xy2, 10 is the coefficient of xy2, x is the Identify the coefficients coefficient of 10y2 and y2 is the coefficient of 10x. Thus, in this more general of the terms of following way, a coefficient may be either a numerical factor or an algebraic factor or expressions: a product of two or more factors. It is said to be the coefficient of the 4x – 3y, a + b + 5, 2y + 5, 2xy product of the remaining factors. EXAMPLE 1 Identify, in the following expressions, terms which are not constants. Give their numerical coefficients: xy + 4, 13 – y2, 13 – y + 5y2, 4p2q – 3pq2 + 5 2024-25 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 163 SOLUTION S.

When terms have different algebraic factors, they are unlike terms. For example, in the expression 2xy – 3x + 5xy – 4, look at the terms 2xy and 5xy. The factors of 2xy are 2, x and y. The factors of 5xy are 5, x and y. Thus their algebraic (i.e., those which contain variables) factors are the same and 2024-25 164 MATHEMATICS hence they are like terms. On the other hand the TRY THESE terms 2xy and –3x, have different algebraic factors. Group the like terms together from the They are unlike terms. Similarly, the terms, 2xy following: and 4, are unlike terms. Also, the terms –3x and 4 12x, 12, – 25x, – 25, – 25y, 1, x, 12y, y are unlike terms. 10.5 MONOMIALS, BINOMIALS, TRINOMIALS AND POLYNOMIALS An expression with only one term is called a monomial; for example, 7xy, – 5m, 3z2, 4 etc. An expression which contains two unlike terms is called a binomial; for example, x + y, m – 5, mn + 4m, a2 – b2 TRY T  are HESE binomials. The expression 10pq is not a binomial; it is a Classify the following monomial. The expression (a + b + 5) is not a binomial. expressions as a monomial, It contains three terms. a binomial or a trinomial: a, An expression which contains three terms is called a a + b, ab + a + b, ab + a trinomial; for example, the expressions x + y + 7, ab + a +b, + b – 5, xy, xy + 5, 3x2 – 5x + 2, m + n + 10 are trinomials. The expression 5x2 – x + 2, 4pq – 3q + 5p, ab + a + b + 5 is, however not a trinomial; it contains four 7, 4m – 7n + 10, 4mn + 7. terms and not three. The expression x +  y + 5x is not a trinomial as the terms x and 5x are like terms. In general, an expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Thus a monomial, a binomial and a trinomial are all polynomials.

Concentrate on the algebraic part of the terms. (ii) Check the variables in the terms. They must be the same. (iii) Next, check the powers of each variable in the terms. They must be the same. Note that in deciding like terms, two things do not matter (1) the numerical coefficients of the terms and (2) the order in which the variables are multiplied in the terms. EXERCISE 10.1 1.

There are a number of situations in which we need to find the value of an expression, such as when we wish to check whether a particular value of a variable satisfies a given equation or not. We find values of expressions, also, when we use formulas from geometry and from everyday mathematics. For example, the area of a square is l2, where l is the length of a side of the square. If l =  5 cm., the area is 52 cm2 or 25 cm2; if the side is 10 cm, the area is 102 cm2 or 100 cm2 and so on. We shall see more such examples in the next section. 2024-25 ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 167 EXAMPLE 4Find the values of the following expressions for x = 2. (i) x + 4 (ii) 4x – 3 (iii) 19 – 5x2 (iv) 100 – 10x3 SOLUTION Putting x = 2 (i) In x + 4, we get the value of x + 4, i.e., x + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 (ii) In 4x – 3, we get 4x – 3 = (4 × 2) – 3 = 8 – 3 = 5 (iii) In 19 – 5x2, we get 19 – 5x2 = 19 – (5 × 22) = 19 – (5 × 4) = 19 – 20 = – 1 (iv) In 100 – 10x3, we get 100 – 10x3 = 100 – (10 × 23) = 100 – (10 × 8) (Note 23 = 8) = 100 – 80 = 20 EXAMPLE 5Find the value of the following expressions when n =  – 2. (i) 5n – 2 (ii) 5n2 + 5n – 2 (iii) n3 + 5n2 + 5n – 2 SOLUTION (i) Putting the value of n = – 2, in 5n – 2, we get, 5(– 2) – 2 = – 10 – 2 = – 12 (ii) In 5n2 + 5n – 2, we have, for n = –2, 5n – 2 = –12 and 5n2 = 5 × (– 2)2 = 5 × 4 = 20 [as (– 2)2 = 4] Combining, 5n2 + 5n – 2 = 20 – 12 = 8 (iii) Now, for n = – 2, 5n2 + 5n – 2 = 8 and n3 = (–2)3 = (–2) × (–2) × (–2) = – 8 Combining, n3 + 5n2 + 5n – 2 = – 8 + 8 = 0 We shall now consider expressions of two variables, for example, x + y, xy. To work out the numerical value of an expression of two variables, we need to give the values of both variables. For example, the value of (x + y), for x = 3 and y = 5, is 3 + 5 = 8. 2024-25 168 MATHEMATICS EXAMPLE 6Find the value of the following expressions for a = 3, b = 2. (i) a + b (ii) 7a – 4b (iii) a2 + 2ab + b2 (iv) a3 – b3 SOLUTION Substituting a = 3 and b = 2 in (i) a + b, we get a + b = 3 + 2 = 5 (ii) 7a – 4b, we get 7a – 4b = 7 × 3 – 4 × 2 = 21 – 8 = 13. (iii) a2 + 2ab + b2,  we get a2 + 2ab + b2 = 32 + 2 × 3 × 2 + 22 = 9 + 2 × 6 + 4 = 9 + 12 + 4 = 25 (iv) a3 – b3, we get a3 – b3 = 33 – 23 = 3 × 3 × 3 – 2 × 2 × 2 = 9 × 3 – 4 × 2 = 27 – 8 = 19 EXERCISE 10.2 1.

Simplify the expression and find its value when a = 5 and b = – 3. 2(a2 + ab) + 3 – ab WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED? 1. Algebraic expressions are formed from variables and constants. We use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the variables and constants to form expressions. For example, the expression 4xy + 7 is formed from the variables x and y and constants 4 and 7. The constant 4 and the variables x and y are multiplied to give the product 4xy and the constant 7 is added to this product to give the expression. 2. Expressions are made up of terms. Terms are added to make an expression. For example, the addition of the terms 4xy and 7 gives the expression 4xy + 7. 3. A term is a product of factors. The term 4xy in the expression 4xy + 7 is a product of factors x,  y and 4. Factors containing variables are said to be algebraic factors. 4. The coefficient is the numerical factor in the term. Sometimes anyone factor in a term is called the coefficient of the remaining part of the term. 5. Any expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Specifically a one term expression is called a monomial; a two-term expression is called a binomial; and a three-term expression is called a trinomial. 6. Terms which have the same algebraic factors are like terms. Terms which have different algebraic factors are unlike terms. Thus, terms 4xy and – 3xy are like terms; but terms 4xy and – 3x are not like terms. 7. In situations such as solving an equation and using a formula, we have to find the value of an expression. The value of the expression depends on the value of the variable from which the expression is formed. Thus, the value of 7x – 3 for x = 5 is 32, since 7(5) – 3 = 35 – 3 = 32. 2024-25
