20 MATHEMATICS Fractions and Decimals 2.1  MULTIPLICATION OF FRACTIONS You know how to find the area of a rectangle. It is equal to length × breadth. If the length and breadth of a rectangle are 7 cm and 4 cm respectively, then what will be its area? Its area would be 7 × 4 = 28 cm2. 1 What will be the area of the rectangle if its length and breadth are 7  cm and 2 1 1 1 15 7 15 3  cm respectively? You will say it will be 7  × 3  =  ×  cm2. The numbers 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 and  are fractions. To calculate the area of the given rectangle, we need to know how to 2 multiply fractions. We shall learn that now. 2.1.1  Multiplication of a Fraction by a Whole Number 1 Observe the pictures at the left (Fig 2.1). Each shaded part is 4 part of a circle. How much will the two shaded parts represent together? 1 1 1 They will represent +  = 2× . 4 4 4 Fig 2.1 Combining the two shaded parts, we get  Fig 2.2 . What part of a circle does the 2 shaded part in Fig 2.2 represent? It represents  part of a circle . 4 Fig 2.2 2024-25 Chapter  2 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 21 The shaded portions in Fig 2.1 taken together are the same as the shaded portion in Fig 2.2, i.e., we get Fig 2.3. = Fig 2.3 1 2 or 2×  =  . 4 4 Can you now tell what this picture will represent? (Fig 2.4) = Fig 2.4 And this? (Fig 2.5) = Fig 2.5 1 Let us now find 3× . 2 1 1 1 1 3 We have 3×  = + + = 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1+1+1 3×1 3 We also have                       + + = = = 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 3×1 3 So 3×  =  = 2 2 2 2 2×5 Similarly ×5  =  = ? 3 3 2 3 Can you tell 3×  = ? 4 × = ? 7 5 1 2 2 3 3 The fractions that we considered till now, i.e., , , , and  were proper fractions. 2 3 7 5 5 2024-25 22 MATHEMATICS For improper fractions also we have, 5 2 × 5 10 2 ×  =  = 3 3 3 8 7 Try, 3×  = ? 4 ×   = ? 7 5 Thus, to multiply a whole number with a proper or an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number with the numerator of the fraction, keeping the denominator same.

It represents 1. 2 1 1 So, we say  of 2 is 1. We can also get it as  × 2 = 1. 2 2 1 1 Thus,  of 2 =  × 2 = 1 2 2 Fig 2.6 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 23 Also, look at these similar squares (Fig 2.7). 1 Each shaded portion represents  of 1. 2 1 So, the three shaded portions represent  of 3. 2 Combine the 3 shaded parts. 1 3 It represents 1  i.e., . 2 2 1 3 1 3 Fig 2.7 So,  of 3 is . Also,  × 3 = . 2 2 2 2 1 1 3 Thus,  of 3 =  × 3 = . 2 2 2 So we see that ‘of’ represents multiplication. 1 Farida has 20 marbles. Reshma has th of the number of marbles what 5 Farida has. How many marbles Reshma has? As, ‘of ’ indicates multiplication, 1 so, Reshma has × 20  = 4 marbles. 5 1 1 16 Similarly, we have of 16 is  ×16  =  =  8. 2 2 2 TRY THESE 1 1 2 Can you tell, what is (i) of 10?,  (ii) of 16?,  (iii)  of 25? 2 4 5 1 EXAMPLE 1 In a class of 40 students  of the total number of studetns like to study 5 2 English,  of the total number like to study Mathematics and the remaining 5 students like to study Science.

How did she do it? She folded the strip twice. What fraction of the total length will each part represent? 9 Each part will be  of the strip. She took one part and divided it in two equal parts by 4 2024-25 26 MATHEMATICS 1 9 folding the part once. What will one of the pieces represent? It will represent  of  or 2 4 1 9 × . 2 4 1 9 Let us now see how to find the product of two fractions like  × . 2 4 1 1 To do this we first learn to find the products like  × . 2 3 1 (a) How do we find  of a whole? We divide the whole in three equal parts. Each of 3 1 Fig 2.8 the three parts represents of the whole. Take one part of these three parts, and 3 shade it as shown in Fig 2.8. A 1 1 (b) How will you find of this shaded part? Divide this one-third ( ) shaded part into 2 3 1 1 1 1 two equal parts. Each of these two parts represents  of   i.e.,  × (Fig 2.9). 2 3 2 3 Fig 2.9 1 1 Take out 1 part of these two and name it ‘A’. ‘A’ represents  × . 2 3 1 (c) What fraction is ‘A’ of the whole? For this, divide each of the remaining  parts also 3 in two equal parts. How many such equal parts do you have now? There are six such equal parts. ‘A’ is one of these parts. 1 1 1 1 So, ‘A’ is  of the whole. Thus,   ×   =  . 6 2 3 6 1 How did we decide that ‘A’ was  of the whole? The whole was divided in 6 = 2 × 3 6 parts and 1 = 1 × 1 part was taken out of it. 1 1 1 1×1 Thus,  ×  =   = 2 3 6 2×3 1 1 1×1 or  ×  = 2 3 2×3 2024-25 FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 27 1 1 The value of ×  can be found in a similar way. Divide the whole into two equal 3 2 parts and then  divide one of these parts in three equal parts. Take one of these parts. This 1 1 will represent  1 ×  i.e., . 3 2 6 1 1 1 1×1 Therefore ×  =  =  as discussed earlier. 3 2 6 3× 2 1 1 1 1 1 Hence  ×  = × = 2 3 3 2 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Find  ×  and  × ; ×   and  ×  and check whether you get 3 4 4 3 2 5 5 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ×  =  × ;  ×  = × 3 4 4 3 2 5 5 2 TRY THESE Fill in these boxes: 1 1 1×1 1 1 (i)  ×  =   = (ii) ×    =   = 2 7 2 × 7 5 7 1 1 1 1 (iii)  ×    =  = (iv)  ×  =  = 7 2 7 5 1 EXAMPLE 2 Sushant reads  part of a book in 1 hour. How much part of the book 3 1 will he read in 2  hours? 5 1 SOLUTION   The part of the book read by Sushant in 1 hour  = . 3 1 1 1 So, the part of the book read by him in 2  hours = 2 × 5 5 3 11 1 11×1 11 = ×  =  = 5 3 5×3 15 1 5 5 1 Let us now find × . We know that    =  × 5 . 2 3 3 3 1 5 1 1 1 5 So,  ×  =  × × 5 = × 5 = 2 3 2 3 6 6 2024-25 28 MATHEMATICS 5 1× 5 1 5 1× 5 5 Also,  =  . Thus, ×  =  = . 6 2 × 3 2 3 2 × 3 6 This is also shown by the figures drawn below. Each of these five equal shapes (Fig 2.10) are parts of five similar circles. Take one such shape. To obtain this shape we first divide a circle in three equal parts. Further divide each of these three parts in two equal parts. One part out of it is the shape we considered. What will it represent? 1 1 1 1 5 It will represent  ×  = . The total of such parts would be  5 ×  = . 2 3 6 6 6 Fig 2.10 TRY THESE 3 1 3×1 3 Similarly  ×  =  = . 5 7 5× 7 35 1 4 2 1 Find:  ×  ;  × 3 5 3 5 2 7 2 7 2 × 7 14 We can thus find  ×  as  ×  =  = . 3 5 3 5 3× 5 15 Product of Numerators So, we find that we multiply two fractions as . Product of Denominators Value of the Products TRY THESE You have seen that the product of two whole numbers is bigger than each of the two whole numbers. For example, 3 × 4 = 12 and 12 > 4, 12 > 3. What 8 4 3 2 happens to the value of the product when we multiply two fractions? Find: × ;    × . 3 7 4 3 Let us first consider the product of two proper fractions.

Or, we say the value of the product of two proper fractions is smaller than each of the two fractions. Check this by constructing five more examples. Let us now multiply two improper fractions. 7 5 35 35 7 35 5 × = > , > Product is greater than each of  the fractions 3 2 6 6 3 6 2 6  24 × = --------,-------- ---------------------------------------5 3 15 9 7 63 × = --------,-------- ---------------------------------------2 8 3 8 24 × = --------,-------- ---------------------------------------7 14 We find that the product of two improper fractions is greater than each of the two fractions. Or, the value of the product of two improper fractions is more than each of the two fractions. Construct five more examples for yourself and verify the above statement. 2 7 Let us now multiply a proper and an improper fraction, say  and . 3 5 2 7 14 14 7 14 2 We have  ×  = .    Here,  <  and  > 3 5 15 15 5 15 3 The product obtained is less than the improper fraction and greater than the proper fraction involved in the multiplication. 6 2 8 4 Check it for  × ,   × . 5 8 3 5 EXERCISE 2.2 1.

Let us see how to do that. 2.2.1  Division of Whole Number by a Fraction 1 Let us find 1÷ . 2 We divide a whole into a number of equal parts such that each part is half of the whole. 1 1 The number of such half ( ) parts would be 1÷ . Observe the figure (Fig 2.11). How 2 2 many half parts do you see? There are two half parts. 1 1 1 2 1 2 So, 1 ÷  = 2. Also, 1×  = 1 × 2 = 2. Thus, 1 ÷  = 1 × 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 Similarly, 3 ÷  = number of parts obtained when each of the 3 whole, are divided Fig 2.11 4 4 1 into equal parts = 12 (From Fig 2.12) 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4 4 Fig 2.12 4 1 4 Observe also that, 3×  =  3 × 4  = 12.
