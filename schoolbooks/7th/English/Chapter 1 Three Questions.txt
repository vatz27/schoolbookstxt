NOTES FOR THE TEACHER General v Learning a language means using it for a wide variety of purposes. Language is best acquired when attention is focused on meaning, not on form. v Words and phrases not closely related to objects and action remain empty and lifeless to young learners. Language comes alive when presented in meaning-making contexts. v Words/phrases that are used to accomplish many useful purposes follow a certain system inherent in the language itself. v Learners become familiar with the system through continuous exposure to the language in meaning-focused situations. v Interaction, discussion and sharing of ideas among learners provide opportunities that elicit ‘real’ information about them and their experiences and opinions. v Encourage learners to work in pairs and small groups and let them go beyond the textbook by providing a variety of language inputs for spontaneous and natural use of language. v Build on the exercises given in the textbook and design more tasks/activities in keeping with learners’ interests, needs and surroundings.  Employ free-response exercises (with more than one possible response). v Promote reading habits through story-reading (not merely teaching stories as texts), story-retelling, choral reading, shared reading, etc. v Create class libraries for exchange of books and shared reading.  The library may also move with children to the next higher class. 2/HONEYCOMB v Introduce advertisement as a genre and discuss with the learners about advertisements on social concerns such as educating the girl child, protecting the environment, saving water. v Poems need not be taught line by line, word by word. You may give a model reading but let every child read the poem on her/his own to feel the richness of language, rhythm and music of words. Exercises accompanying the poem are more for understanding the poem as a whole than for teaching language items. v Encourage learners to tell new stories, narrate  anecdotes, compose short poems in English or their own language, talk about pictures, illustrations in the book and cartoons in newspapers/magazines. Don’t get anxious about the errors they will make. Constant exposure, practice and correction in the form of feedback will help them improve themselves by and by. v Every page has a column for words and meanings. Encourage children to write down other words they  find difficult, along with their meanings, in this column. UNITS 1–3 Three Questions Some suggestions given below are applicable to all prose lessons in the book. v A Tolstoy story — the three questions in the opening paragraph, though philosophical in nature, may be of practical significance to individuals in self-realisation and value inculcation. v Spend about 10 minutes discussing the questions the king asks. Let children express their views.  Even if their observations do not reveal any understanding of the questions, the discussion session will provide an excellent base for the work to follow. v The story is sectioned in two parts.  Each part may be sectioned further according to convenience and time available. v ‘Comprehension Check’ at the end of each section is a recall of what they have read so far.  Design while-reading comprehension exercises in the form of factual NOTES TFHORE TEH QE UTESATCIHOENRS/3 comprehension questions, multiple choice questions and/or completion of sentences, etc. v While covering portions of the text, either talk about the illustrations or ask children to tell you about them. Illustrations are there not merely for decoration but mainly for comprehension. v Questions under ‘Working with the Text’ to be answered orally, later to be written in the copybook. v At the end of the lesson, draw children’s attention to the three questions in the context of the present period/class. Isn’t the present period the right time to do as best you can the task in hand jointly with the member(s)  of the group for her/his good  and your own ? The Squirrel v Drawing a squirrel or finding the picture of a squirrel and describing it variously will commit learners’ interest to the poem they are reading. v Help them find ‘wear’ and its usage in the dictionary. Avoid fixed phrases like ‘wear and tear’ or ‘wear one’s heart on one’s sleeve’, etc. Draw their attention to sentences like the following. • She wore  a plain dress but an enigmatic smile. • Should a man wear a lady’s perfume ? v The illustration given in the book may generate comments such as the following. • The squirrel’s tail looks like a question mark. • It reminds me of the mark of punctuation that comes at the end of an interrogative sentence. • Looking at this squirrel, you might say it was asking a question.  What is the question ? • The squirrel is wearing a long overcoat reaching the tip of its tail. • If it begins to run now, its tail will look like the bushy end of a painter’s brush. 4/HONEYCOMB v Speak the words given below.  Ask children to write the word and against it two new words that rhyme. gray ————————— ————————— mark ————————— ————————— went ————————— ————————— nut ————————— ————————— A Gift of Chappals v Children’s world — their spontaneity  and imagination, ability to see contradictions in normal behaviour and moving acts of charity. v While covering sections and sub-sections of the text, focus on situations in which children see themselves. v Elicit their comments on, and reactions to, Ravi’s exaggerations about the kitten’s ancestry, children cleverly feeding the kitten and Mridu and Meena’s final act of charity. Focus on values such as sincerity, care and compassion as exemplified in the episodes. v Under ‘Working with Language’, highlight some points about the use of if-clauses. (i) An if-clause, also known as a conditional clause, expresses a condition or cause whose result/effect is felt in the second part of the sentence. (ii) If the verb in the if-clause is in the present tense, the other clause normally has ‘will + verb’. (iii) An if-clause can be placed either at the beginning or at the end of the main clause. • I’ll come to your house if it doesn’t rain. Or • If it doesn’t rain, I’ll come to your house. v Activity 2 under ‘Speaking and Writing’ lends itself to picking up appropriate language to learn and practise life skills such as decision-making, negotiating, persuading, etc.  Let all the children in pairs/groups perform this activity. Help them, wherever necessary, with appropriate language use. NOTES FOR THE TEACHER/5 The Rebel v Activity 1 is a combination of open-ended as well as text-based responses. Items (ii) and (iii) entail recalling/ looking at the appropriate lines in the poem whereas (i), (iv), (v) and (vi) are discussion points. v Let children read Introduction to the poem silently and find the desired word.  The significance of the title will, then, become amply  clear. v The poem contains 15 couplets.  Each couplet may be recited as an independent unit. v Ask children if they think the last couplet expresses the poet’s own opinion and comment. v Relate the last couplet to the discussion item (vi) under Activity 1. Gopal and the Hilsa Fish v A comic story to be understood through pictures with strips of text for support.  Children will have a natural enthusiasm for this new kind of material. v Divide the class into small groups.  Let each group look at and describe a set of pictures (assigned to them) and construct their own text.  Texts thus produced can be put together to form a complete story, to be edited for coherence and accuracy. If necessary, texts may first be produced in the child’s own language, and the teacher can help them to reformulate these in English. Conversely, for children fluent in English, this may be an opportunity to formulate equivalent texts in their own languages. v Picture reading under ‘Speaking and Writing’ to be attempted in the same manner. v Word ladder provides an opportunity for vocabulary building. Elicit the required word from learners by providing a set of synonyms for it. cross: angry, annoyed, displeased tiny: small, little, negligible 6/HONEYCOMB The Shed v Ask children to look for words/phrases in the poem suggesting the neglected state of the shed like “spider’s web hanging”, “rusty” in the first stanza. There are four more in the second stanza. v Let children cull out three or four pairs of rhyming words that come at the end of lines. v Activity 2 will generate a lot of individual contributions. Children may even make up spooky stories and quote them as ‘real’ experiences.  Show interest and belief in each anecdote. For the Teacher Have a discussion in the class on the wordle given below. Sensitise the learners towards digital mode of payment. 1 Before you read A king has three questions and he is seeking answers to them. What are the questions? Does the king get what he wants?

Only in this way, they said, could he do —————– everything at its proper time. Others said that it was impossible to decide in advance the right time —————– for doing something. The king should notice all —————– that was going on, avoid foolish pleasures, and —————– 8/HONEYCOMB always do whatever seemed necessary at that time. Yet others said that the king needed a council of wise men who would help him act at the proper time.
