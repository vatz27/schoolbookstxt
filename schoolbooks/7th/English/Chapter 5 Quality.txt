72/HONEYCOMB 5 Before you read Can a shoemaker be called an artist? Yes, if he has the same skill and pride in his trade as any other artist, and the same respect for it too. Mr Gessler, a German shoemaker settled in London, is a perfect artist. Read this story to see how he devotes his life to his art. Quality I knew him from the days of my —————– extreme youth, because he made my —————– father’s boots. He lived with his elder brother in —————– his shop, which was in a small by-street in a —————– fashionable part of London. —————– The shop had a certain quiet distinction. There was no sign upon it other than the name of Gessler —————– Brothers; and in the window a few pairs of boots. —————– He made only what was ordered, and what he —————– made never failed to fit. To make boots—such —————– boots as he made—seemed to me then, and still —————– seems to me, mysterious and wonderful. —————– I remember well my shy remarks, one day, while “It is an art.” (said with a stretching out to him my youthful foot. “Isn’t it German awfully hard to do, Mr Gessler?” And his answer, accent) given with a sudden smile from out of the redness lasted of his beard: “Id is an ardt!’’ terribly: lasted very It was not possible to go to him very often— long his boots lasted terribly, having something 2024-25 QUALITY/73 beyond the temporary, some essence of boot stitched into them.

And “fortnight” as I moved to the door, I would hear the tip-tap “brother” of his slippers going up the stairs: to his dream of boots. 2024-25 QUALITY/75 I cannot forget that day on which I had occasion to say to him, “Mr Gessler, that last pair of boots creaked, you know.” He looked at me for a time without replying, “It shouldn't as if expecting me to withdraw or qualify the have creaked.” statement, then said,“ld shouldn’d ’ave greaked.’’ “You got them “It did, I’m afraid.” wet before they found “You god dem wed before dey found themselves.” demselves.” “Send them “I don’t think so.” back.

He took my order without —————– showing me any leather and I could feel his eyes —————– penetrating the inferior covering of my foot. At last he said, “Dose are nod my boods.” “Those are not my boots.” The tone was not one of anger, nor of sorrow, —————– not even of contempt, but there was in it —————– something quiet that froze the blood. He put his —————– hand down and pressed a finger on the place —————– where the left boot was not quite comfortable. —————– “Id ’urds’ you dere,” he said, “Dose big virms —————– ’ave no self-respect.” And then, as if something had “It hurts you given way within him, he spoke long and bitterly. there.

But when I came to where his shop —————– had been, his name was gone. —————– I went in very much disturbed. In the shop, —————– there was a young man with an English face. —————– “Mr Gessler in?” I said. —————– “No, sir,” he said. “No, but we can attend to —————– anything with pleasure. We’ve taken the shop —————– over.” —————– “Yes. yes,” I said, “but Mr Gessler?” —————– “Oh!” he answered, “dead.” —————– “Dead!

Mention the things trees give us. Then read this poem about trees. Trees are for birds. Trees are for children. Trees are to make tree houses in. Trees are to swing swings on. Trees are for the wind to blow through. Trees are to hide behind in ‘Hide and Seek.’ Trees are to have tea parties under. Trees are for kites to get caught in. Trees are to make cool shade in summer. Trees are to make no shade in winter. Trees are for apples to grow on, and pears; Trees are to chop down and call, “TIMBER-R-R!” Trees make mothers say, “What a lovely picture to paint!” Trees make fathers say, “What a lot of leaves to rake this fall !” SHIRLEY BAUER 2024-25 QUTARLEIETYS/85 Working with the Poem 1. What are the games or human activities which use trees, or in which trees also ‘participate’? 2. (i) “Trees are to make no shade in winter.” What does this mean? (Contrast this line with the line immediately before it.) (ii) “Trees are for apples to grow on, or pears.” Do you agree that one purpose of a tree is to have fruit on it? Or do you think this line is humorous? 3. With the help of your partner, try to rewrite some lines in the poem, or add new ones of your own as in the following examples. Trees are for birds to build nests in. Trees are for people to sit under. Now try to compose a similar poem about water, or air. What Are Mangrove Forests? ‘Mangrove’ is the name commonly used for varieties of shrubs or trees growing in the muddy swamps of tropical coasts and estuaries. Mangroves produce tangled roots that grow above the ground. They produce new trunks and thus rapidly form a dense growth. Mangrove timber is impervious to water and is resistant to marine worms. 2024-25
