The first set of teeth grows during infancy and they fall off at the age between six to eight years. These are termed milk teeth. The second set that replaces them are the permanent teeth. The permanent teeth may last throughout life or fall off during old age or due to some dental disease. Molar Boojho is fascinated by the Premolar highly coiled small intestine seen in Fig. 2.2.

We can find out the Sweets and tooth decay Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating, (a) many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release acids (see Chapter 4 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not (b) treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and other sugar products are the major culprits of tooth decay. Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or datun and (c) dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between two teeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day and rinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

This happens when food particles enter the windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage. Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel choked, get hiccups or cough. 5. Now write down your observations and label Fig. 2.6. Repeat this activity with other classmates.

The stomach The liver is a reddish brown gland The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its situated in the upper part of the shape is like a flattened J and it is the abdomen on the right side. It is the widest part of the alimentary canal. It largest gland in the body. It secretes bile receives food from the food pipe at one juice that is stored in a sac called the end and opens into the small intestine gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays at the other. an important role in the digestion of fats.

The pancreatic juice the lining of the stomach. The acid kills acts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins many bacteria that enter along with the and changes them into simpler forms. The working of the stomach was discovered by a strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole in his stomach. He was brought to an American army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved the patient but he could not close the hole properly and left it bandaged (Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as a great opportunity to see the inside of the stomach through the hole. He made some wonderful observations. Beaumont found that the stomach was churning Fig. 2.8  Alexis St. Martin’s shotgun wound food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest the food. He also observed that the end of the stomach opens into the intestine only after the digestion of the food inside the stomach is completed. 16 SCIENCE Reprint 2024-25 The partly digested food now reaches the proteins required by the body.

Actually, they via the blood vessels to different organs quickly swallow the grass and store of the body where they are used to build it in a part of the stomach called complex substances such as the rumen (Fig. 2.9). Here the food gets Diarrhoea Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently. This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children. Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).

It consists of the (i) buccal cavity, (ii) oesophagus, (iii) stomach, (iv) small intestine, (v) large intestine ending in rectum and (vi) anus. The main digestive glands which secrete digestive juices are (i) the salivary glands, (ii) the liver and (iii) the pancreas. The stomach wall and the wall of the small intestine also secrete digestive juices.  The modes of feeding vary in different organisms.  Nutrition is a complex process involving: (i) ingestion, (ii) digestion, (iii) absorption, (iv) assimilation and  (v) egestion. NUTRITION IN ANIMALS 19 Reprint 2024-25  Digestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The digestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from the liver, the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juice from the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of food in the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vessels from the small intestine.  The absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body. Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in the large intestine.  The undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the body as faeces through the anus.  The grazing animals like cows, buffaloes and deer are known as ruminants. They quickly ingest, swallow their leafy food and store it in the rumen. Later, the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews it peacefully.  Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia. The food is digested in the food vacuole.
