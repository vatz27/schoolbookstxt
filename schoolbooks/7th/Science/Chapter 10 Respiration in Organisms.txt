In the symbol of the electric cell, the longer line represents the positive terminal and the thicker, shorter line represents the negative terminal. For a switch the ‘ON’ position and the ‘OFF’ position are represented by the symbols as shown. The wires used to connect the various components in a circuit are represented by lines.

ELECTRIC CURRENT AND ITS EFFECTS 113 Reprint 2024-25 connecting to the electric supply, their elements become red hot and give out heat. The amount of heat produced in a wire depends on its material, length and thickness. Thus, for different requirements, the wires of different materials and different lengths and thicknesses are used. The wires used for making electric circuits do not normally become hot. On the other hand, the elements of some electric appliances become so hot that Fig. 10.12  Glowing filament of an electric bulb they are easily visible. The filament of (incandescent) Incandescent electric bulbs (Fig. 10.12) are often used for lighting but they also give heat. It means that a part of electricity consumed is used in producing heat. This is not desirable as it results in the wastage of electricity. The fluorescent tube-lights and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are better electricity efficient lighting sources. Nowadays, the use of light emitting diode (LED) bulbs is increasing. For producing a given intensity of light, LED bulbs consume less electricity as compared to incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes or CFLs.Thus LED bulbs are much electricity efficient and therefore being preferred.

Bureau of Indian Standards, New Delhi assigns a Standard Mark on products, called ISI mark  which is an assurance of conformity to the specifications given on the products. It is therefore suggested to use ISI mark products. Note: Fluorescent tubes and CFLs contain mercury vapour, toxic in nature. Therefore, damaged fluorescent tubes or CFLs need to be disposed off safely. 114 SCIENCE Reprint 2024-25 Fig. 10.15  Fuses used in electrical appliances buildings fuses are inserted in all electrical circuits.

An electrician is carrying out some repairs in your house.  He wants to replace a fuse by a piece of wire.  Would you agree? Give reasons for your response. 12. Zubeda made an electric circuit using a cell holder shown in Fig. 10.4, a switch and a bulb. When she put the switch in the ‘ON’ position, the bulb did not glow. Help Zubeda in identifying the possible defects in the circuit. 13. In the circuit shown in Fig. 10.25 A B C Fig. 10.25 (i) Would any of the bulb glow when the switch is in the ‘OFF’ position?

Set up the circuit shown in Fig. 10.17 again. Move the key to ‘ON’ position and watch carefully in which direction the compass needle gets deflected. Switch ‘OFF’ the current. Now keeping rest of the circuit intact, reverse the connections at the terminal of the cell. Again switch ‘on’ the current. Note the direction in which the needle gets deflected. Think of an explanation. Paheli and Boojho saw a magic trick sometime back. The magician placed an iron box on a stand. He then called Boojho and asked him to lift the box. Boojho could easily lift the box. Now the magician made a show of moving his stick around the box while muttering some thing. He again asked Boojho to lift the box. This time Boojho could not even move it. The magician again muttered some thing and now Boojho could lift the box. The audience, including Paheli and Boojho, were very impressed with the show and felt that the magician had some supernatural powers. However, after reading this chapter Paheli is wondering if the trick was indeed some magic or some science was involved? Can you guess what science might be involved?
