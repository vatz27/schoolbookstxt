7 Transportation in Animals and Plants You have learnt earlier that all organisms need food, water and oxygen for survival. They need to transport all these to various parts of their body. Further, animals need to transport wastes to parts from where they can be removed. Have you wondered how all this is achieved? Look at Fig. 7.1. Do you see the heart and Heart the blood vessels? They function to Vein transport substances and together form the circulatory system. In this chapter, you shall learn about transport of Artery substances in animals and plants. 7.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM Blood What happens when you get a cut on your body? Blood flows out. But what is blood? Blood is the fluid which flows in blood vessels. It transports substances like digested food from the small intestine to the other parts of the body. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the cells of the body. It also transports waste for removal from the body. How does the blood carry various substances? Blood is composed of a fluid, called plasma in which different types of cells are suspended. Why is the colour of Fig. 7.1  Circulatory system blood red? (Arteries are shown in red colour and veins in blue) Reprint 2024-25 One type of cells are the red blood Since the blood flow is rapid and at a cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment high pressure, the arteries have thick called haemoglobin.

You know that during Insert the values you obtained in inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills Table 7.1 and compare them. the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported to the rest of the body. Also, the blood picks up the waste materials including carbon dioxide from the cells. This blood has to go back to the heart for transport to the lungs for removal of carbon dioxide as you have learnt in Chapter 6. So, two types of blood vessels,  arteries and veins are present in the body. (Fig. 7.1) Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to all parts of the body.

The capillaries join to form veins which empty into the heart. Heart Capillaries The heart is an organ which beats continuously to act as a pump for the transport of blood, which carries other Fig. 7.3  Schematic diagram of circulation substances with it. Imagine a pump working for Blood Donation years without stopping! Absolutely Hundreds of people die due to impossible. Yet our heart works like a unavailability of blood.

Animals such in the cells of the living organisms is as sponges and Hydra do not possess called excretion. The parts involved in any circulatory system. The water in excretion form the excretory system. which they live brings food and oxygen Excretory system in humans The waste which is present in the blood The English physician, William Harvey has to be removed from the body. How (A.D.1578–1657), discovered the can this be done? A mechanism to filter circulation of blood. The current the blood is required. This is done by opinion in those days was that blood the blood capillaries in the kidneys. oscillates in the vessels of the body. When the blood reaches the two kidneys, For his views, Harvey was ridiculed it contains both useful and harmful and was called “circulator”. He lost substances. The useful substances are most of his patients. However, before absorbed back into the blood. The he died, Harvey’s idea about wastes dissolved in water are removed circulation was generally accepted as as urine. From the kidneys, the urine a biological fact. goes into the urinary bladder through TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS 75 Reprint 2024-25 contains water and salts. Boojho has seen that sometimes in summer, white patches are formed on our clothes, Kidney especially in areas like underarms. These marks are left by salts present in the sweat. Does sweat serve any other function? We know that the water kept in an earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is because the water evaporates from the Ureter pores of the pot, which causes cooling. Paheli wants to know whether other animals also urinate? Urinary bladder The way in which waste chemicals Urethra are removed from the body of the animal depends on the availability of water. Aquatic animals like fishes, Urinary opening excrete cell waste as ammonia which Fig. 7.6  Human excretory system directly dissolves in water. Some land animals like birds, lizards, tube-like ureters. It is stored in the snakes excrete a semi-solid, white bladder and is passed out through the coloured compound (uric acid). The urinary opening at the end of a major excretory product in humans muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 7.6). is urea. The kindeys, ureters, bladder and urethra form the excretory system. Sometimes a person’s kidneys may An adult human being normally stop working due to infection or passes about 1–1.8 L of urine in 24 injury. As a result of kidney failure, hours.

You also learnt in Chapter 6 that food is the source of energy Boojho thinks that plants and every cell of an organism gets energy may have pipes to transport by the breakdown of glucose. The cells water to the entire plant like we have in our homes for the use this energy to carry out vital activities supply of water. of life. Therefore food must be made available to every cell of an organism. Have you ever wondered how water and nutrients absorbed by the root are transported to the leaves? How is the food prepared by the leaves carried to the parts which cannot make food? Transport of water and minerals Plants absorb water and minerals by the roots. The roots have root hair. Root hair (b) (a) Xylem vessels Fig. 7.7  Transport of water and minerals in (a) a section of root, (b) a tree TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS 77 Reprint 2024-25 Well, Boojho is right. Plants have pipe-like vessels to transport water and nutrients from the soil. The vessels are made of special cells, forming the vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of cells that perform specialised function in an organism. The vascular tissue for the transport of water and nutrients in the plant is called the xylem [Fig. 7.7 (a)]. Fig. 7.8 (a) Stem placed in coloured water The xylem forms a continuous network of channels that connects roots to the leaves through the stem and branches and thus transports water to the entire plant [Fig. 7.7 (b)].

The food has to be transported to moves up the stem. In other words, stem all parts of the plant. This is done by conducts water.

Observe it the next day. 78 SCIENCE Reprint 2024-25 Transpiration on the surface of the leaves by the process In Class VI you learnt that plants of transpiration. The evaporation of water release a lot of water by the process of from leaves generates a suction pull (the transpiration. same that you produce when you suck Plants absorb mineral nutrients and water through a straw) which can water from the soil. Not all the water pull water to great heights in the absorbed is utilised by the plant. The water tall trees. Transpiration also cools evaporates through the stomata present the plant.

It also carries waste products from different parts of the body for excretion.  Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.  In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts as a pumping organ.  Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.  The human heart beats about 70–80 times per minute in an adult person. This is called heart rate.  Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.  Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.  Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion. TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS 79 Reprint 2024-25  Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a urinary bladder, and urethra.  Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat.  Fish excrete waste substances such as ammonia which directly dissolve in water.  Birds, insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semi-solid form.  Water and mineral nutrients are absorbed by roots from the soil.  Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the vascular tissue called xylem.  The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the plant is phloem.  A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata during transpiration.  Transpiration generates a force which pulls up water absorbed by the roots from the soil, to reach the stem and leaves.

Extended Learning — Activities and Projects 1. Find out about blood groups and their importance. 2. When a person suffers from chest pain, the doctor immediately takes an ECG. Visit a doctor and get information about ECG. You may even look up an encyclopaedia or the internet. Did you know? There is no substitute for blood. If people lose blood from surgery or injury or if their bodies cannot produce enough blood, there is only one way to get it — through transfusion of blood donated by volunteers. Blood is usually in short supply. Donating blood does not decrease the strength of the donors. TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS 81 Reprint 2024-25
