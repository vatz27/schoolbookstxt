5 Women Change the World In the previous chapter, we saw how womens work in the home is not recognised as work. We also read how doing household work and taking care of family members is a full time job and there are no specific hours at which it begins or ends. In this chapter, we will look at work outside the home, and understand how some occupations are seen to be more suitable for men than for women. We will also learn about how women struggle for equality. Getting an education was, and still is, one way in which new opportunities were created for women. This chapter will also briefly trace the different types of efforts made by the womens movement to challenge discrimination in more recent years. 48 Social and Political Life CHAPTER Who does what work?

Scientist 25 5 Pilot 27 3 50 Social and Political Life Fewer opportunities and rigid expectations A lot of the children in Rosie Maams class drew women as nurses and men as army officers. The reason they did this is because they feel that outside the home too, women are good at only certain jobs. For example, many people believe that women make better nurses because they are more patient and gentle. This is linked to womens roles within the family. Similarly, it is believed that science requires a technical mind and girls and women are not capable of dealing with technical things. Because so many people believe in these stereotypes, many girls do not get the same support that boys do to study and train to become doctors and engineers. In most families, once girls finish school, they are encouraged by their families to see marriage as their main aim in life. Breaking stereotypes Engine drivers are men. But 27-year-old Laxmi Lakra, from a poor tribal family in Jharkhand has begun to change things. She is the first woman engine driver for Northern Railways. Laxmis parents are not literate but they struggled and overcame many hardships to make sure their children got an education. Laxmi studied in a government school. Even in school, Laxmi helped with the housework and did odd jobs. She studied hard and did well and then went on to get a diploma in electronics. She then took the railway board exam and passed it on her first attempt. Laxmi says, I love challenges and the moment somebody says it is not for girls, I make sure I go ahead and do it.  Laxmi has had to do this several times in her life  when she wanted to take electronics; when she rode motorcycles at the polytechnic; and when she decided to become an engine driver. Her philosophy is simple  As long as I am having fun without harming anyone, as long as I am doing well and helping my parents,  why should I not lead a lifestyle of my choice? (Adapted from Driving Her Train by Neeta Lal, Womens Features Service) Chapter 5: Women Change the World 51 It is important to understand that we live in a Read the story below and answer society in which all children face pressures from the the questions  world around them.

As more and more children enter school every year, we begin to think that it is normal for all children to go to school. Today, it is difficult for us Ramabai (18581922), shown above to imagine that school and learning could be seen with her daughter, championed the cause as out of bounds or not appropriate for some of womens education. She never went to children. But in the past, the skill of reading and school but learnt to read and write from writing was known to only a few. Most children learnt her parents. She was given the title the work their families or elders did. For girls, the Pandita because she could read and situation was worse. In communities that taught sons write Sanskrit, a remarkable to read and write, daughters were not allowed to learn achievement as women then were not the alphabet. Even in families where skills like allowed such knowledge. She went on to pottery, weaving and craft were taught, the set up a Mission in Khedgaon near Pune contribution of daughters and women was only seen in 1898, where widows and poor women as supportive. For example, in the pottery trade, were encouraged not only to become women collected the mud and prepared the earth literate but to be independent. They were for the pots. But since they did not operate the wheel, taught a variety of skills from carpentry they were not seen as potters. to running a printing press, skills that are not usually taught to girls even today. In the nineteenth century, many new ideas about The printing press can be seen in the education and learning emerged. Schools became picture on the top left corner. Ramabais more common and communities that had never Mission is still active today. learnt reading and writing started sending their children to school. But there was a lot of opposition to educating girls even then. Yet many women and men made efforts to open schools for girls. Women struggled to learn to read and write. Chapter 5: Women Change the World 53 Let us read about the experience of Rashsundari Devi (18001890), who was born in West Bengal, some 200 years ago. At the age of 60, she wrote her autobiography in Bangla. Her book titled Amar Jiban is the first known autobiography written by an Indian Learning to read and write led some woman. Rashsundari Devi was a housewife from a women to question the situation of rich landlords family. At that time, it was believed women in society. They wrote stories, that if a woman learnt to read and write, she would letters and autobiographies describing bring bad luck to her husband and become a widow! their own experiences of inequality. In Despite this, she taught herself how to read and write their writings, they also imagined new in secret, well after her marriage. ways of thinking and living for both men and women. I would start working at dawn, and I would still be at it until well beyond midnight. I had no rest in between. I was only fourteen years old at the time. I came to nurture a great longing: I would learn to read and I would read a religious manuscript. I was Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain and her dreams about Ladyland Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880 1932) was born into a rich family who owned a lot of land.  Though she knew how to read and write Urdu, she was stopped from learning Bangla and English. In those days, English was seen as a language that would expose girls to new ideas, which people thought were not correct for them. Therefore, it was mostly boys who were taught English. Rokeya learnt to read and write Bangla and English with the support of her elder brother and an elder sister.  She went on to become a writer. She wrote a remarkable story titled Sultanas Dream in 1905 to practise her English skills when she was merely 25 years old. This story imagined a woman called Sultana who reaches a place called Ladyland. Ladyland is a place where women had the freedom to study, work, and create inventions like controlling rain from the clouds and flying air cars. In this Ladyland, the men had been sent into seclusion  their aggressive guns and other weapons of war defeated by the brainpower of women. As Sultana travels in Ladyland with Sister Sarah, she awakes to realise that she was only dreaming. As you can see, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain was dreaming of women flying planes and cars even before girls were being allowed to go to school! This was the way in which education and learning had changed Rokeyas own life.  Rokeya did not stop at getting education just for herself. Her education gave her the power not only to dream and write, but also to do more  to help other girls go to school and to build their own dreams.  In 1910, she started a school for girls in Kolkata, and to this day, the school is still functioning. 54 Social and Political Life unlucky, in those days women were not educated. Later, I began to resent my own thoughts. What is wrong with me? Women do not read, how will I do it? Then I had a dream: I was reading the manuscript of Chaitanya Bhagabat (the life of a saint) Later in the day, as I sat cooking in the kitchen, I heard my husband say to my eldest son: Bepin, I have left my Chaitanya Bhagabat here. When I ask for it, bring it in. He left the book there and went away. When the book had been taken inside, I secretly took out a page and hid it carefully. It was a job hiding it, for nobody must find it in my hands. My eldest son was practising his alphabets at that time. I hid one of them as well. At times, I went over that, trying to match letters from that page with the letters that I remembered. I also tried to match the words with those that I would hear in the course of my days. With tremendous care and effort, and over a long period of time, I learnt how to read Unlike Rashsundari Devi and Rokeya Hossain, who were not allowed to learn After learning the alphabet, Rashsundari Devi was to read and write, large numbers of girls able to read the Chaitanya Bhagabat. Through her attend school in India today. Despite this, own writing she also gave the world an opportunity there continue to be many girls who leave to read about womens lives in those days. school for reasons of poverty, inadequate Rashsundari Devi wrote about her everyday life schooling facilities and discrimination. experiences in details. There were days when she Providing equal schooling facilities to did not have a moments rest, no time even to sit children from all communities and class down and eat! backgrounds, and particularly girls, continues to be a challenge in India. Schooling and education today Today, both boys and girls attend school in large numbers. Yet, as we will see, there still remain differences between the education of boys and girls. India has a census every 10 years, which counts the whole population of the country. It also gathers detailed information about the people living in India  their age, schooling, what work they do, and so on. We use this information to measure many things, like the number of literate people, and the ratio of men and women. According to the 1961 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) census, about 40 per cent of all boys and men www.in.undp.org Chapter 5: Women Change the World 55 (7 years old and above) were literate (that is, they could at least write their names) compared to just 15 per cent of all girls and women. In the most recent census of 2011, these figures have grown to 82 per cent for boys and men, and 65 per cent for girls and women. This means that the proportion of both men and women who are now able to read and have at least some amount of schooling has increased. But, as you can also see, the percentage of the male group is still higher than the female group. The gap has not gone away. Here is a table that shows the percentage of girls and boys who leave schools from different social groups including Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST). Average Annual Drop-out Rate in School Education (201415) (in percentage) Level All         SC         ST Boys Girls Total Boys Girls Total Boys Girls Total Primary (Classes 1-5) 4.36 3.88 4.13 4.71 4.20 4.46 7.02 6.84 6.93 Upper Primary (Classes 6-8) 3.49 4.60 4.03 5.00 6.03 5.51 8.48 8.71 8.59 Secondary (Classes 9-10) 17.21 16.88 17.06 19.64 19.05 19.36 24.94 24.40 24.68 Source: Educational Statistics at a Glance, MHRD, 2018 What percentage of children leave You have probably noticed in the above table that school at the upper primary level?

There are several reasons why children from Dalit, Adivasi and Muslim communities leave school. In many parts of the country, especially in rural and poor areas, there may not even be proper schools nor teachers who teach on a regular basis. If a school 56 Social and Political Life is not close to peoples homes, and there is no transport like buses or vans, parents may not be willing to send their girls to school. Many families are too poor and unable to bear the cost of educating all their children. Boys may get preference in this situation. Many children also leave school because they are discriminated against by their teacher and classmates. 10 Find out about the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao 8 campaign launched in 2014. 6 From the given table, convert the figures of primary class children 4 who leave school into a bar All ST diagram.

There are other spheres  like legal reform, violence and health  where the situation of women and girls has improved. These changes have not happened automatically. Women individually, and collectively have struggled to bring about these changes. This struggle is known as the Womens Movement. Individual women and womens organisations from different parts of the country are part of the movement. Many men support the womens movement as well. The diversity, passion and efforts of those involved makes it a very vibrant movement. Different strategies have been used to spread awareness, fight discrimination and seek justice. Here are some glimpses of this struggle. Chapter 5: Women Change the World 57 Percentage Campaigning Campaigns to fight discrimination and violence against women are an important part of the womens movement. Campaigns have also led to new laws being passed. A law was made in 2006 to give women who face physical and mental violence within their homes, also called domestic violence, some legal protection. Similarly, efforts made by the womens movement led the Supreme Court to formulate guidelines in 1997 to protect women against sexual harassment at the workplace and within educational institutions. Satyarani, an active member of the womens movement, sitting on the steps of the Supreme Court surrounded by legal In the 1980s, for example, womens files gathered during the course of a long legal battle to seek groups across the country spoke out justice for her daughter who was murdered for dowry. against dowry deaths  cases of young brides being murdered by their in-laws or husbands, greedy for more dowry. Womens groups spoke out against the failure to bring these cases to justice. They did so by coming on to the streets, approaching the courts, and by sharing information. Eventually, this became a public issue in the newspapers and society, and the dowry laws were changed to punish families who seek dowry. Raising Awareness An important part of the womens movements work is to raise public awareness on womens rights issues. Their message has been spread through street plays, songs and public meetings. Protesting The womens movement raises its voice when violations against women take place or for example, when a law or policy acts against their interests. Public rallies and demonstrations are a very powerful way of drawing attention to injustices. Showing Solidarity The womens movement is also about showing solidarity with other women and causes. Below: On 8 March, International Womens Day, women all over the world come together to celebrate and renew their struggles. Above: Women are holding up candles to demonstrate the solidarity between the people of India and Pakistan. Every year, on 14 August, several thousand people gather at Wagah on the border of India and Pakistan and hold a cultural programme. 60 Social and Political Life EXERCISES 1. How do you think stereotypes, about what women can or cannot do, affect womens right to equality? 2. List one reason why learning the alphabet was so important to women like Rashsundari Devi, Ramabai and Rokeya. 3. Poor girls drop out of school because they are not interested in getting an education. Re-read the last paragraph on page 62 and explain why this statement is not true. 4. Can you describe two methods of struggle that the womens movement used to raise issues? If you had to organise a struggle against stereotypes, about what women can or cannot do, what method would you employ from the ones that you have read about? Why would you choose this particular method? Glossary Stereotype: When we believe that people belonging to particular groups based on religion, wealth, language are bound to have certain fixed characteristics or can only do a certain type of work, we create a stereotype. For example, in this chapter, we saw how boys and girls are made to take certain subjects not because he or she has an aptitude for it, but because they are either boys or girls. Stereotypes prevent us from looking at people as unique individuals. Discrimination: When we do not treat people equally or with respect we are indulging in discrimination. It happens when people or organisations act on their prejudices. Discrimination usually takes place when we treat some one differently or make a distinction. Violation: When someone forcefully breaks the law or a rule or openly shows disrespect, we can say that he or she has committed a violation. Sexual harassment: This refers to physical or verbal behaviour that is of a sexual nature and against the wishes of a woman.
