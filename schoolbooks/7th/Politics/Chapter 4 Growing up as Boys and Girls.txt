4 Growing up as Boys and Girls Being a boy or a girl is an important part of ones identity. The society we grow up in teaches us what kind of behaviour is acceptable for girls and boys, what boys and girls can or cannot do. We often grow up thinking that these things are exactly the same everywhere. But do all societies look at boys and girls in the same way? We will try and answer this question in this chapter. We will also look at how the different roles assigned to boys and girls prepare them for their future roles as men and women. We will learn that most societies value men and women differently. The roles women play and the work they do are usually valued less than the roles men play and the work they do. This chapter will also examine how inequalities between men and women emerge in the area of work. CHAPTER Growing up in Samoa in the 1920s The Samoan Islands are part of a large group of small islands in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean. In the 1920s, according to research reports on Samoan society, children did not go to school. They learnt many things, such as how to take care of children or do household work from older children and from adults. Fishing was a very important activity on the islands. Young people, therefore, learnt to undertake long fishing expeditions. But they learnt these things at different points in their childhood. As soon as babies could walk, their mothers or other adults no longer looked after them. Older children, often as young as five years old, took over this responsibility. Both boys and girls looked after A Class VII Samoan child their younger siblings. But, by the time a boy was in his school uniform. about nine years old, he joined the older boys in learning outdoor jobs like fishing and planting In what ways do the experiences coconuts.

Cooking was done in special cooking-houses, where boys were supposed to do most of the work while girls helped with the preparations. Growing up male in Madhya Pradesh in the 1960s The following is adapted from an account of experiences of being in a small town in Madhya Pradesh in the 1960s. From Class VI onwards, boys and girls went to separate schools. The girls school was designed very differently from the boys school. They had a central Why do girls like to go to school courtyard where they played in total seclusion and together in groups?

If we talk to elders reasons why this might be so? in our family, we will see that their childhoods were What would happen if you probably very different from ours. replaced the girls with the boys and vice-versa? We also realise that societies make clear distinctions between boys and girls. This begins from a very young age. We are for example, given different toys to play with. Boys are usually given cars to play with and girls dolls. Both toys can be a lot of fun to play with. Why are girls then given dolls and boys cars? Toys become a way of telling children that they will have different futures when they become men and women. If we think about it, this difference is created in the smallest and most everyday things. How girls must dress, what games boys should play, how girls need to talk softly or boys need to be tough. All these are ways of telling children that they have specific roles to play when they grow up to be men and women. Later in life this affects the subjects we can study or the careers we can choose. In most societies, including our own, the roles men and women play or the work they do, are not valued equally. Men and women do not have the same status. Let us look at how this difference exists in the work done by men and women. 40 Social and Political Life MY MOTHER Harmeets mother Shonali, how can Yes, but thats not real DOES NOT WORK always comes for you say that!

Hee hee... I wonder if they still believe I dont work?...and now I have to remind them that Chachaji and Chachiji are coming for dinner. Valuing housework Harmeets family did not think that the work Jaspreet did within the house was real work. This feeling is not unique to their families. Across the world, the main responsibility for housework and care-giving tasks, like looking after the family, especially children, the elderly and sick members, lies with women. Yet, as we have seen, the work that women do within the home is not recognised as work. It is also assumed that this is something that comes naturally to women. It, therefore, does not have to be paid for. And society devalues this work. 42 Social and Political Life Lives of domestic workers In the story above, Harmeets mother was not the only one who did the housework. A lot of the work was done by Mangala, their domestic helper. Many homes, particularly in towns and cities, employ domestic workers. They do a lot of work  sweeping and cleaning, washing clothes and dishes, cooking, looking after young children or the elderly. Most domestic workers are women. Sometimes, even young boys or girls are employed to do this work. Wages are low, as domestic work Melani with her daughter. does not have much value. A domestic workers day can begin as early as five in the morning and end as late as twelve at night! Despite the hard work they do, their employers often do not show them much respect. This is what Melani, a domestic worker had to say about her experience of working in Delhi  My first job was with a rich family that lived in a three-storeyed house. The memsahib was very strange as she would shout Were Harmeet and Shonali correct to get any work done. My work was in the kitchen. in saying that Harmeets mother There were two other girls who did the cleaning. did not work? Our day would begin at 5 oclock. For breakfast we would get a cup of tea and two dry rotis. We What do you think would happen could never get a third roti. In the evening, when if your mother or those involved I cooked the food, the two other girls would beg in doing the work at home went me to give them an extra roti. I would secretly on a strike for a day? give it to them and make an extra one for myself. We were so hungry after working through the day!

Do you think they used to feel scared of the memsahib but also felt should? angry and humiliated. Did we not work all day? Did we not deserve to be treated with some respect? In fact, what we commonly term as housework actually involves many different tasks. A number of these tasks require heavy physical work. In both rural and urban areas women and girls have to fetch water. In rural areas women and girls carry heavy headloads of firewood. Tasks like Chapter 4: Growing up as Boys and Girls 43 washing clothes, cleaning, sweeping and picking up loads require bending, lifting and carrying. Many chores, like cooking, involve standing for long hours in front of hot stoves. The work women do is strenuous and physically demanding  words that we normally associate with men. Another aspect of housework and care-giving that we do not recognise is that it is very time consuming. In fact, if we add up the housework and the work, women do outside the home, we find that women spend much more time working than men and have much less time for leisure. Below is some data from a special study done by the Central Statistical Organization of India (19981999). See if you can fill in the blanks. State Women Paid Women Unpaid Women Men Paid Men Unpaid Men (Work hours (Housework (Total) (Work hours (Housework (Total) per week) hours per week) per week) hours per week) Haryana 23 30 ? 38 2 ?

As we have seen the low value attached to womens household and care-giving work is not an individual How does this compare with the or family matter. It is part of a larger system of total number of work hours spent inequality between men and women. It, therefore, by men? has to be dealt with through actions not just at the level of the individual or the family but also by the government. As we now know, equality is an important principle of our Constitution. The Constitution says that being male or female should Many women like Shonalis mother in not become a reason for discrimination. In reality, the story and the women in Tamil Nadu inequality between the sexes exists. The government and Haryana who were surveyed work is, therefore, committed to understanding the reasons both inside and outside the home. This is for this and taking positive steps to remedy the often referred to as the double burden of situation. For example, it recognises that burden of womens work. child-care and housework falls on women and girls. 44 Social and Political Life This naturally has an impact on whether Children at an Anganwadi centre in a girls can attend school. It determines village in Madhya Pradesh. whether women can work outside the house and what kind of jobs and careers they can have. The government has set up anganwadis or child-care centres in several villages in the country. The government has passed laws that make it mandatory for organisations that have more than 30 women employees to provide crèche facilities. The provision of crèches helps many women to take up employment outside the home. It also makes it possible for more girls to attend schools.

Does this have any relationship to the roles children have to play as adults? 4. If you have someone working as a domestic help in your house or locality talk to her and find out a little bit more about her life  Who are her family members?  Where is her home?  How many hours does she work?  How much does she get paid?  Write a small story based on these details. Glossary Identity: Identity is a sense of self-awareness of who one is. Typically, a person can have several identities. For example, a person can be a girl, a sister and a musician. Double-burden: Literally means a double load. This term is commonly used to describe the womens work situation. It has emerged from a recognition that women typically labour both inside the home (housework) and outside. Care-giving: Care-giving refers to a range of tasks related to looking after and nurturing. Besides physical tasks, they also involve a strong emotional aspect. De-valued: When someone is not given due recognition for a task or job they have done, they can feel de-valued. For example, if a boy has put in a lot of effort into making a special birthday gift for his friend and this friend does not say anything about this, then the boy may feel de-valued.
