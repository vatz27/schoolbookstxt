This could be through the provision of education, health, employment, housing or the development of roads, electricity etc. In this chapter we shall examine the meanings and problems related to health. Look at the sub-headings of this chapter. In what ways do you think this topic is related to the work of government? 12 CHAPTER What is health? We can think of health in many ways. Health means our ability to remain free of illness and injuries. But health isnt only about disease. You may have associated only some of the situations in the above Would you associate all or some of collage with health. What we often ignore is the fact these pictures with health ? In that each of the above situations is related to health. what ways? Discuss in groups. Apart from disease, we need to think of other factors that affect our health. For example, if people get clean drinking water or a pollution free environment they are likely to be healthy. On the other hand, if people Pick two situations from the above do not get adequate food to eat or have to live in collage that are not related to cramped conditions, they will be prone to illness. illness and write two sentences on how they are related to health. All of us would like to be active and in good spirits in whatever we may be doing. It isnt healthy to be dull, inactive, anxious or scared for long stretches of time. We all need to be without mental strain. All of these various aspects of our lives are a part of health.

The country also has considerable queues in government hospitals, like experience and knowledge in running a public this one. healthcare system. This is a system of hospitals and health centres run by the government. It has the ability to look after the health of a large section of its population scattered over hundreds of thousands of villages. We will go into more detail on this later. Moreover, there has been a phenomenal advancement in medical sciences whereby many new technologies and treatment procedures are available in the country. However, the second column points out how poor the health situation in our country is. With all the above positive developments we are not able to provide proper healthcare facilities to people. This is the paradox  something that is contrary to what we would expect. Our country has the money, knowledge and people with experience but cannot make the necessary healthcare available to all. In this chapter, we will look at some of the reasons for this. Chapter 2: Role of the Government in Health 15 THE COST OF A CURE Aman and Ranjan are good friends.

According to our Constitution, it is the primary duty of the government to ensure the welfare of the people and provide health care facilities to all.

If a hospital cannot provide timely medical treatment to a person, it means that this protection of life is not being given. The Court also said that it was the duty of the government to provide the necessary health services, including treatment in emergency situations. Hospitals and medical staff must fulfil their duty of providing the necessary treatment. Therefore, the Court asked the State Government to give him the money that he had spent on his treatment. Private health facilities There is a wide range of private health facilities that exist in our country. A large number of doctors run their own private clinics.

Chapter 2: Role of the Government in Health 19 Today the presence of private facilities can be seen all around. In fact now there are large companies that run hospitals and some are engaged in manufacturing and selling medicines. Medical shops are found in every corner of the country. Healthcare and equality: Is adequate healthcare available to all? A post-operative room in a leading In India, we face a situation where private services private hospital in Delhi. are increasing but public services are not. What is then available to people are mainly private services. These are concentrated in urban areas. The cost of these services is rather high. Medicines are expensive. Many people cannot afford them or have to borrow money when there is an illness in the family. Private health facilities can mean many things. Explain with the help Some private services encourage incorrect of some examples from your area. practices to earn more. At times inexpensive alternatives, though available, may not be used. For example, some medical practitioners are found to prescribe superfluous medicines, injections or saline when simple medication may suffice. The Medical Council of Indias  In fact, barely 20 per cent of the population can Code of Medical Ethics states: afford all the medicines that they require during an Every physician should, as far as illness.

Discuss. 20 Social and Political Life think as being poor, medical expenses cause hardship. It was reported in a study that 40 per cent of people who are admitted to a hospital for some illness or injury have to borrow money or sell some of their possessions to pay for the expenses. For those who are poor, every illness in the family is a cause of great anxiety and distress. What is worse is that this situation tends to happen again and In rural areas, a jeep is often used to again. Those who are poor are in the first place serve as a mobile clinic for patients. undernourished. These families are not eating as much as they should. They are not provided basic necessities like drinking water, adequate housing, clean surroundings, etc., and therefore, are more likely to fall ill. The expenses on illness make their situation even worse. Sometimes it is not only the lack of money that prevents people from getting proper medical treatment. Women, for example, are not taken to a doctor in a prompt manner. Womens health concerns are considered to be less important than the health of men in the family. Many tribal areas have few health centres and they do not run properly. This pregnant lady has to travel many Even private health services are not available. kilometres to see a qualified doctor. What can be done? There is little doubt that the health situation of most people in our country is not good. It is the responsibility of the government to provide quality healthcare services to all its citizens, especially the poor and the disadvantaged. However, health is as much dependent on basic amenities and social conditions of the people, as it is on healthcare services. Hence, it is important to work on both in order to improve the health situation of our people. And this can be done. Look at the following example. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) www.in.undp.org Chapter 2: Role of the Government in Health 21 The Kerala experience In 1996, the Kerala government made some major changes in the state. Forty per cent of the entire state budget was given to panchayats. They could plan and provide for their requirements. This made it possible for a village to make sure that proper planning was done for water, food, womens development and education. This meant that water supply schemes were checked, the working of schools and anganwadis was ensured and specific problems of the village were taken up. Health centres were also improved. All of this helped to improve the situation. Despite these efforts, however, some problems  such as shortage of medicines, insufficient hospital beds, not enough doctors  remained, and these needed to be addressed.

Page 97 of this book has a map of India. The Costa Rican approach Using your pencil outline the state of Kerala on this map. Costa Rica is considered to be one of the healthiest countries in Central America. The main reason for this can be found in the Costa Rican Constitution. Several years ago, Costa Rica took a very important decision and decided not to have an army. This helped the Costa Rican government to spend the money that the army would have used, on health, education and other basic needs of the people. The Costa Rican government believes that a country has to be healthy for its development and pays a lot of attention to the health of its people. The Costa Rican government provides basic services and amenities to all Costa Ricans. For example, it provides safe drinking water, sanitation, nutrition and housing. Health education is also considered very important and knowledge about health is an essential part of education at all levels. 22 Social and Political Life EXERCISES 1.
