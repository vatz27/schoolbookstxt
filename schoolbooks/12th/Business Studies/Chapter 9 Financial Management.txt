These project has to be evaluated carefully and, depending upon the returns, a particular project is either selected or rejected. If there is only one project, its viability in terms of the rate of return, viz., investment and its comparability with the industry’s average is seen. There are certain factors which affect capital budgeting decisions. (a) Cash flows of the project: When a company takes an investment decision involving huge amount it expects to generate some cash flows over a period. These cash flows are in the form of a series Wealth Maximisation Concept of cash receipts and payments over the life of an investment.

Learning how to manage debt is what can put you ahead. Taking on the right amount of debt can mean the difference between a business struggling to survive and one that can respond nimbly to changing economic or market conditions. A number of circumstances may justify acquiring debt. As a general rule, borrowing makes the most sense when you need to bolster cash flow or finance growth or expansion. But while debt can provide the leverage you need to grow, too much debt can strangle your business. So the question is: How much debt is too much? The answer, experts say, lies in a careful analysis of your cash flow as well as your industry. A business that doesn’t grow dies. You’ve got to grow, but you’ve got to grow within the financial constraints of your business. What is the ideal capital structure a business needs in its industry to remain viable? The higher the volatility (in your industry), the less debt you should have. The smaller the volatility, the more debt you can afford. Although banks and other financial institutions look for a satisfactory debt-toequity ratio before agreeing to make a loan, don’t assume a creditor’s willingness to extend funds is evidence that your business is in a strong debt position. Some financial institutions are overzealous lenders, particularly when trying to lure or hold on to promising business customers. “The bank may be looking more at collateral than whether the (business’s) earnings are going to come in to justify the debt service. To avoid these and other credit pitfalls, it’s up to you to get the financial facts on your business and make sound borrowing decisions. Unfortunately, many entrepreneurs fail to recognise how important financial analysis is to running a successful business. Even business owners who receive detailed financial statements from their accountants often do not take advantage of the valuable information contained in the documents. the company in preparing for the  (vi) It provides a l ink between future. investment and financing decisions (iii) If helps in co-ordinating various on a continuous basis. business functions, e.g., sales and  (vii) By spelling out detailed objectives production functions, by providing for various business segments, it clear policies and procedures. makes the evaluation of actual (iv) Detailed plans of action prepared performance easier. under financial planning reduce waste, duplication of efforts, and caPital Structure gaps in planning.
