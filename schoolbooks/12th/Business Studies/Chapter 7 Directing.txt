She was recognised by her peers and supervisors as a person who managed department in a good way. However, everyone realised that Rashmi was extremely ambitious and was seeking a higher-level management position. When one of her sales representatives did a good job, she would attempt to take the credit. However, if a problem arose, she thought it was not her fault. When the marketing manager retired, Rashmi applied for the position. The company decided to do a thorough search because of the responsibility and importance associated with the position. When the search was concluded, the decision was made to fill the position by a person from outside the company. The consensus of top management was that Rashmi, although a good district sales manager might have difficulties in working with her new peer groups. They felt that she might displease the other managers if she tried to take credit for their work and, as a result, their performance would suffer. Rashmi was heart-broken. She had wanted that particular job for a long time and had dedicated all her energies towards obtaining it. She became very despondent and her work deteriorated. The department functioned inspite of her, not because of her. Decisions were made slowly if at all and she began to be late with her sales reports. Although her sales staff continued to be productive, Rashmi could not take the credit. When the new marketing manager took over, one of the first major problems that he confronted was how to motivate and inspire Rashmi to her former level of performance. He recognised that Rashmi had been with the company for a long time but something had to be done to motivate her to perform really well.

Motivation is something which moves the person to action and continues him in the course of action already initiated.

Motivating Employees in Tata Steel In Tata Steel several initiatives have been taken to further improve the motivation levels and participation in the decision making process of the officers, greater impetus to training through a formalised system of a personal development programme, talent review and job rotation systems, compensation linked to the performance management system, formal rewards and recognition systems, knowledge management systems linked with appraisals, leadership opportunities in quality circles, continuous improvement and value engineering programmes and an extremely transparent and credible multi-path communication system to address queries and concerns of all employees through various dialogues both formal and online, with such tools as video conferencing, ‘MD Online’, special dialogues with senior management, meetings, conferences and seminars. These initiatives have helped to build a homogeneous and focused team in Tata Steel, increasing motivation and binding to the vision of the company and spurred employees to deliver targets on a participatory management basis leading to ownership of processes. Tata Steel is a company that actively promotes freedom to work, freedom to innovate and even the freedom to fail. It is a nimble, fast, modern and forward-looking company on a strong growth path. The company has undergone a revolutionary change in terms of its production facilities and the technology in the manufacturing process. These changes have resulted in creating greater opportunities for taking up newer challenges for young recruits work and for performance based on IT enabled systems and high levels of automation. These have led to making the company one of the lowest cost producers of steel and the only Indian company to be recognised by the World Steel Dynamics as one of the top most ‘World Class’ steel makers. Tata Steel hopes not only to consolidate but better its leadership by robust leadership development systems that have seen the company create many CEOs for other companies. http://www.tata.com/tata_steel/releases/20030829.htm Reprint 2024-25 Ch_07.indd   177 08-08-2022   10:35:54 178 Business Studies Unsatisfied Need as well as the organisation.

Maslow was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1908. He studied primate behavior at the University of Wisconsin, where he received his doctorate in psychology in 1934. Early in his career, Maslow was drawn to the study of human motivation and personality. His work in this area upset strict behaviorists, whose explanations of motivation and personality failed to account for what Maslow called the whole person. His theory of the hierarchy of needs, which leads to the ‘selfactualised’ individual, was a strong catalyst for the founding of humanistic psychology. Maslow successfully bridged motivation and personality in his theories of needs, self-actualising persons, and peak experiences. Maslow is considered an important figure in contemporary psychology. His career was a formidable one. For 14 years he taught at Brooklyn College, and then went to Brandeis University as chairman of the Psychology Department. In 1968 he was elected president of the American Psychological Association. In 1969 he went to the Laughlin Foundation in Menlo Park, California. He wrote two important books: Toward a Psychology of Being (1968) and Motivation and Personality (1970).

Definitions of Leadership Leadership is the activity of influencing people to strive willingly for group objectives. George Terry Leadership is the art or process of influencing people so that they will strive willingly and enthusiastically towards the achievement of group goals. Harold Koontz and Heinz Weihrich Leadership is a set of interpersonal behaviours designed to influence employees to cooperate in the achievement of objectives. Glueck Leadership is both a process and property. The process of leadership is the use of noncoercive influence to direct and coordinate the activities of the members of an organised group towards the accomplishment of group objectivities. As a property, leadership is the set of qualities or characteristics attributed to those who are perceived to successfully employ such influence.
