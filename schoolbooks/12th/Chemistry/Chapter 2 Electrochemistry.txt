Reprint 2024-25 2.1 Electrochemical We had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell (Fig. 2.1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the Cells redox reaction Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) (2.1) to electrical energy and has an electrical potential equal to 1.1 V when concentration of Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions is unity (1 mol dm–3)*. Such a device is called a galvanic or a voltaic cell. If an external opposite potential is applied in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased slowly, we find that the reaction continues to take place till the opposing voltage reaches the value 1.1 V [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction stops altogether and no current flows through the cell. Any further increase in the external potential again starts the reaction but in the opposite direction [Fig. 2.2(c)]. It now functions as an electrolytic cell, a device for using electrical energy to carry non-spontaneous chemical reactions. Both types of cells are Fig. 2.1: Daniell cell having electrodes of zinc and quite important and we shall study some of copper dipping in the solutions of their their salient features in the following pages. respective salts.

Chemistry 32 Reprint 2024-25 2.2 Galvanic Cells As mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running a motor or other electrical gadgets  like heater, fan, geyser, etc. Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs. Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s) This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction: (i) Cu2+   +  2e–    ® Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2) (ii) Zn(s)  ® Zn2+ + 2e– (oxidation half reaction) (2.3) These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1.  Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with  respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. 33 Electrochemistry Reprint 2024-25 The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right  while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e., E = E – E cell right  left This is illustrated by the following example: Cell reaction: Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ¾® Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4) Half-cell reactions: Cathode (reduction):   2Ag+(aq) + 2e– ® 2Ag(s) (2.5) Anode (oxidation):    Cu(s)  ® Cu2+(aq) + 2e– (2.6) It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s) and we have E  = E  – E  = E ( cell right left Ag+ú  – E Ag Cu2+ú 2.7) Cu 2.2.1 The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can Measurement measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that of Electrode gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one Potential electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half-cell called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3) represented by Pt(s)ú H (g)ú H+(aq), is assigned 2 a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction 1 H+ (aq) + e–  ®  H (g) 2 2 The standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it.  The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the Fig. 2.3: Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). solution is one molar. Chemistry 34 Reprint 2024-25 At 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode ççsecond half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode (reference half-cell) and the other half-cell  as cathode, gives the reduction potential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity, then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, o E R of the given half-cell. o E  = o o E R – E L As o E L for standard hydrogen electrode is zero. o o o E  = E R – 0 = E R The measured emf of the cell: + Pt(s) ç H2(g, 1 bar) ç  2+ H (aq, 1 M) çç Cu  (aq, 1 M) ú Cu is 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential of the half-cell corresponding to the reaction: 2+ – Cu  (aq, 1M) + 2 e   ®  Cu(s) Similarly, the measured emf of the cell: Pt(s) ç + H2(g, 1 bar) ç  2+ H (aq, 1 M) çç Zn  (aq, 1M) ç Zn is -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the half-cell reaction: 2+ – Zn  (aq, 1 M) + 2e  ®  Zn(s) The positive  value of the standard electrode potential in the first 2+ + case indicates that Cu  ions get reduced more easily than H  ions. The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu (or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not dissolve in HCl.  In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion.  The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions). In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 2.1 can be written as: 2 Left electrode: Zn(s) ® + – Zn  (aq, 1 M) + 2 e 2+ – Right electrode: Cu  (aq, 1 M) + 2 e  ® Cu(s) The overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation: 2+ 2+ Zn(s) + Cu  (aq) ® Zn (aq) + Cu(s) emf of the cell = o o E cell = E R – o E L = 0.34V – (– 0.76)V = 1.10 V Sometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes. They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons. For example, Pt is used in the following half-cells: Hydrogen electrode:  Pt(s)|H (g)| H+(aq) 2 With half-cell reaction:  H+ (aq)+ e– ® ½ H (g) 2 Bromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br (aq)| Br–(aq) 2 35 Electrochemistry Reprint 2024-25 With half-cell reaction: ½ Br (aq) + e– ® Br–(aq) 2 The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F ) has the maximum 2 tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F–) and therefore fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties and for potentiometric titrations. Intext Questions 2.1 How would you determine the standard electrode potential of the system Mg2+|Mg? 2.2 Can you store copper sulphate solutions in a zinc pot? 2.3 Consult the table of standard electrode potentials and suggest three substances that can oxidise ferrous ions under suitable conditions. 2.3 Nernst We have assumed in the previous section that the concentration of all Equation the species involved in the electrode reaction is unity. This need not be always true. Nernst showed that for the electrode reaction: Mn+(aq) + ne– ® M(s) the electrode potential at any concentration measured with respect to standard hydrogen electrode can be represented by: o RT [M] E ( n + ) = E M / M (Mn + /M)  –   ln [Mn+ nF ] but concentration of solid M is taken as unity and we have o RT 1 E( E Mn+ ) = / M (Mn+ /M)  –  ln n+ (2.8) nF [M ] o E (Mn+ / M) has already been defined, R is gas constant (8.314 JK–1 mol–1), F is Faraday constant (96487 C mol–1), T is temperature in kelvin and [Mn+] is the concentration of the species, Mn+.

It increases with increase in the concentration of Cu2+ ions and decrease in the concentration of Zn2+ ions. By converting the natural logarithm in Eq.

At the same time voltage of the cell as read on the voltmeter keeps on decreasing. After some time, we shall note that there is no change in the concentration of Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions and at the same time, voltmeter gives zero reading. This indicates that equilibrium has been attained. In this situation the Nernst equation may be written as: 2.3 3RT [Zn2+ ] E  = 0 = o 0 E (cell) (  – lo cell) g 2F [Cu2+ ] 2.303 2 RT [Zn ] or o E(  = log cell) 2 [Cu2 F ] But at equilibrium, + [Zn2 ] 2+  = K for the reaction 2.1 [Cu ] c and at T = 298K the above equation can be written as o 0.059 V E(  =  log K  = 1.1 V         ( o E cell) 2 C ( = 1.1V) cell) (1.1V × 2) log K  =  37.288 C 0.059 V K  = 2 × 1037 at 298K.

Thus, equilibrium constants of the reaction, difficult to measure otherwise, can be calculated from the corresponding o E  value of the cell. 39 Electrochemistry Reprint 2024-25 Example 2.2 Calculate the equilibrium constant of the reaction: Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ® Cu2+(aq) + 2Ag(s) Eo (  = 0.46 V cell) Solution o 0.059 V E(cell) =  log K  = 0.46 V or 2 C 0.46 V ×2 log K =   5.6 C 0 = .059 V 1 K = 3.92 × 1015 C 2.3.2 Electro- Electrical work done in one second is equal to electrical potential chemical multiplied by total charge passed. If we want to obtain maximum work Cell and from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The Gibbs reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to decrease in its Gibbs Energy of energy and therefore, if the emf of the cell is E and nF is the amount the Reaction of charge passed and D G is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then r D G = – nFE (2.15) r (cell) It may be remembered that E  is an intensive parameter but D G (cell) r is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value depends on n. Thus, if we write the reaction Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ¾® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) (2.1) D G = – 2FE r (cell) but when we write the reaction 2 Zn (s) + 2 Cu2+(aq) ¾®2 Zn2+(aq) + 2Cu(s) D G = – 4FE r (cell) If the concentration of all the reacting species is unity, then E  = o E (cell (  and we have ) cell) o o D G = – nF E r (cell) (2.16) Thus, from the measurement of o E( )  we can obtain an important cell thermodynamic quantity, o D G , standard Gibbs energy of the reaction. r From the latter we can calculate equilibrium constant by the equation: o D G  = –RT ln K. r Example 2.3 The standard electrode potential for Daniell cell is 1.1V.

The electrical resistance is represented by the symbol ‘R’ and it is measured in ohm (W) Solutions which in terms of SI base units is equal to (kg m2)/( 3 S  2 A ). It can be measured with the help of a Wheatstone bridge with which you are familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its area of cross section, A. That is, l l R µ  or R = r (2.17) A A The constant of proportionality, r (Greek, rho), is called resistivity (specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre (W m) and quite often its submultiple, ohm centimetre (W cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area of cross section is one m2. It can be seen that:
