For example, which parameters determine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling? Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an auto engine? All these questions can be answered by the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from the Greek word ‘kinesis’ meaning movement. Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate of a reaction.  For example, thermodynamic data indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think Reprint 2024-25 that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions, are discussed. In this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given. However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the reaction rate. 3 . 1 Rate of a Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, Chemical precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other Reaction hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate speed. Can you think of more examples from each category? You must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain period of time. Similarly, the speed of  a reaction or  the rate of a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of  a reactant or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in terms of: (i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the reactants, or (ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products. Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the system remains constant. R ® P One mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If [R]   and [P]  are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time t 1 1 1 and [R]  and [P]  are their concentrations at time  t  then, 2 2 2 Dt = t  – t 2 1 D[R] = [R] – [R] 2 1 D [P] = [P]  – [P] 2 1 The square brackets in the above expressions are used to express molar concentration. Rate of disappearance of R Decrease in concentration of R [R ] = = − ∆ ∆ (3.1) Time taken t Chemistry 62 Reprint 2024-25 Rate of appearance of P Increase in concentration of P P = = + ∆ [ ] (3.2) Time taken ∆t Since, D[R] is a negative quantity (as concentration of reactants is decreasing), it is multiplied with –1 to make the rate of the reaction a positive quantity. Equations (3.1) and (3.2) given above represent the average rate of a reaction, r . av Average rate depends upon the change in concentration of reactants or products and the time taken for that change to occur (Fig. 3.1). {         } Fig. 3.1:  Instantaneous and average rate of a reaction Units of rate of a reaction From equations (3.1) and (3.2), it is clear that units of rate are concentration time–1. For example, if concentration is in  mol L–1  and time is in seconds then the units will be mol L-1s–1. However, in gaseous reactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their partial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm s–1. From the concentrations of C H Cl (butyl chloride) at different times given Example 3.1 4 9 below, calculate the average rate of the reaction: C H Cl  +  H O  ®  C H OH + HCl 4 9 2 4 9 during different intervals of time. t/s 0 50 100 150 200 300 400 700 800 [C H Cl]/mol L–1 0.100 0.0905 0.0820 0.0741 0.0671 0.0549 0.0439 0.0210 0.017 4 9 We can determine the difference in concentration over different intervals Solution of time and thus determine the average rate by dividing D[R] by Dt (Table 3.1). 63 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2024-25 Table 3.1: Average rates of hydrolysis of butyl chloride [C H CI]  / [C H CI]  / t /s t /s r  × 104/mol L–1s–1 4 9 t1 4 9 t 1 2 av 2 mol L–1 mol L–1 = – {[C4H9Cl] – [C H9Cl] / (t − t } ×104 t 4 t 2 1) 2 1 0.100 0.0905 0 50 1.90 0.0905 0.0820 50 100 1.70 0.0820 0.0741 100 150 1.58 0.0741 0.0671 150 200 1.40 0.0671 0.0549 200 300 1.22 0.0549 0.0439 300 400 1.10 0.0439 0.0335 400 500 1.04 0.0210 0.017 700 800 0.4 It can be seen (Table 3.1) that the average rate falls from 1.90 ×  0-4 mol L-1s-1 to 0.4 × 10-4 mol L-1s-1. However, average rate cannot be used to predict the rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular moment of time we determine the instantaneous rate. It is obtained when we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say dt ( i.e. when Dt approaches zero). Hence, mathematically for an infinitesimally small dt instantaneous rate is given by = −∆ [R ] P rav = ∆ [ ] ∆ ( . t ∆ 3 3) t dR  d P As  Dt ® 0 or rinst   dt dt Fig 3.2 Instantaneous rate of hydrolysis of butyl chloride(C H Cl) 4 9 Chemistry 64 Reprint 2024-25 It can be determined graphically by drawing a tangent at time t on either of the curves for concentration of R and P vs time t and calculating its slope (Fig. 3.1). So in problem 3.1, r at 600s for example, can be inst calculated by plotting concentration of butyl chloride as a function of time. A tangent is drawn that touches the curve at t = 600 s (Fig. 3.2). The slope of this tangent gives the instantaneous rate. So, r at 600 s = –   mol L–1 = 5.12 × 10–5 mol L–1s–1 inst At t = 250 s r  = 1.22 × 10–4 mol L–1s–1 inst t = 350 s r  = 1.0 × 10–4 mol L–1s–1 inst t = 450 s r  = 6.4 ×× 10–5 mol L–1s–1 inst Now consider a reaction Hg(l) + Cl (g) ® HgCl (s) 2  2 Where stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products are same, then rate of the reaction is given as ∆ [Hg] ∆ [Cl2 ] ∆ [HgCl ] Rate of reaction = – = – = 2 ∆t ∆t ∆t i.e., rate of disappearance of any of the reactants is same as   the rate of appearance of the products. But in the following reaction, two moles of HI decompose to produce one mole each of H and I 2 2, 2HI(g)   ® H (g)   +   I (g) 2 2 For expressing the rate of such a reaction where stoichiometric coefficients of reactants or products are not equal to one, rate of disappearance of any of the reactants or  the rate of appearance of products is divided by their respective stoichiometric coefficients. Since rate of consumption of HI is twice the rate of formation of H  or I , to 2 2 make them equal, the term D[HI]  is divided by 2. The rate of this reaction is given by Rate  of reaction  = − 1 ∆ [HI] ∆[H= 2 ] ∆ [I= 2 ] 2 ∆t ∆t ∆t Similarly, for the reaction 5 Br- (aq) + BrO – (aq) + 6 H+ (aq)  ®  3 Br  (aq) + 3 H O (l) 3 2 2 − [Br−  − 1 ∆ ] ∆ BrO  ∆ H+ Br H Rate = = −  3  1 1 = − [ ] 1 ∆ = [ 2 ] ∆ = [ 2O] 5 ∆t ∆t 6 ∆t 3 ∆t 3 ∆t For a gaseous reaction at constant temperature, concentration is directly proportional to the partial pressure of a species and hence, rate can also be expressed as rate of change in partial pressure of the reactant or the product. 65 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2024-25 Example 3.2 The decomposition of N O  in CCl  at 318K has been studied by 2 5 4 monitoring the concentration of N O in the solution. Initially the 2 5 concentration of N O  is 2.33 mol L–1 and after 184 minutes, it is reduced 2 5 to 2.08 mol L–1. The reaction takes place according to the equation 2 N O  (g) ®  4 NO  (g) + O  (g) 2 5 2 2 Calculate the average rate of this reaction in terms of hours, minutes and seconds.

Calculate the average rate of reaction using units of time both in minutes and seconds. 3.2 In a reaction, 2A ®  Products, the concentration of A decreases from 0.5 mol L–1 to 0.4 mol L–1 in 10 minutes. Calculate the rate during this interval? 3.2 Factors Influencing Rate of reaction depends upon the experimental conditions such Rate of a Reaction as concentration of reactants (pressure in case of gases), temperature and catalyst. 3.2.1 Dependence The rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature may depend on of Rate on the concentration of one or more reactants and products.  The Concentration representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the reactants is known as rate law. It is also called as rate equation or rate expression. 3.2.2 Rate The results in Table 3.1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with Expression the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease.  Conversely, and Rate rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase. So, rate of Constant a reaction depends upon the concentration of reactants. Chemistry 66 Reprint 2024-25 Consider a general reaction aA + bB   ®   cC + dD where a, b, c and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants and products. The rate expression for this reaction is x y Rate µ [A]  [B] (3.4) where exponents x and y may or may not be equal to the stoichiometric coefficients (a and b) of the reactants. Above equation can also be written as x y Rate = k [A]  [B] (3.4a) − d [R ] = k [ ]x A [ ]y B (3.4b) dt This form of equation (3.4 b) is known as differential rate equation, where  k is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The equation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the expression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar concentration of reactants with each term raised to some power, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric coefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical equation. For example: 2NO(g) + O (g) ® 2NO  (g) 2 2 We can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants constant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by changing the concentration of both the reactants. The following results are obtained (Table 3.2). Table 3.2: Initial rate of formation of NO 2 Experiment Initial [NO]/ mol L-1 Initial [O ]/ mol L-1 Initial rate of 2 formation of NO / mol L-1s-1 2 1. 0.30 0.30 0.096 2. 0.60 0.30 0.384 3. 0.30 0.60 0.192 4. 0.60 0.60 0.768 It is obvious, after looking at the results, that when the concentration of NO is doubled and that of O  is kept constant then the initial rate 2 increases by a factor of four from 0.096 to 0.384 mol L–1s–1. This indicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of NO.  When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of O  is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends 2 on concentration of O to the first power.  Hence, the rate equation for 2 this reaction will be 2 Rate = k [NO] [O2] 67 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2024-25 The differential form of this rate expression is given as − d[R] = k [ ]2NO [O2 ] dt Now, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived from the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms are the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. Some other examples are given below: Reaction Experimental rate expression 1. CHCl  + Cl  ®  CCl  + HCl Rate = k [CHCl  ]  [Cl ]1/2 3 2 4 3 2 2. CH COOC H  + H O ®  CH COOH + C H OH Rate = k [CH COOC H ]1 [H O]0 3 2 5 2 3 2 5 3 2 5 2 In these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not the same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that: Rate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at the balanced chemical equation, i.e., theoretically but must be determined experimentally. 3.2.3 Order of a In the rate equation (3.4) Reaction Rate = k [A]x  [B]y x and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration of A and B.  Sum of these exponents, i.e., x + y in (3.4) gives the overall order of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect to the reactants A and B respectively. Hence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the reactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that chemical reaction. Order of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero order reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the concentration of reactants. Example 3.3 Calculate the overall order of a reaction which has the rate expression (a) Rate = k [A]1/2 [B]3/2 (b) Rate = k [A]3/2 [B]–1 Solution (a) Rate = k [A]x  [B]y order = x + y So order = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, i.e., second order (b) order = 3/2 + (–1) = 1/2,  i.e., half order. A balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how a reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one step.  The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary reactions.  When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism) gives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions. Chemistry 68 Reprint 2024-25 These may be consecutive reactions (e.g., oxidation of ethane to CO2 and H2O passes through a series of intermediate steps in which alcohol, aldehyde and acid are formed), reverse reactions and side reactions (e.g., nitration of phenol yields o-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol). Units of rate constant For a general reaction aA + bB ® cC + dD x y Rate = k [A]  [B] Where x + y = n = order of the reaction Rate k = [A]x [B]y concentration 1 = × where [A] [B] time n ( = ) (concentration) Taking SI units of concentration, mol L–1 and time, s, the units of k for different reaction order are listed in Table 3.3 Table 3.3: Units of rate constant Reaction Order Units of rate constant molL−1 Zero order reaction 0 × 1 = molL−1s−1 s (molL−1 )0 molL−1 × 1 = s−1 First order reaction 1 s (molL−1)1 molL−1 × 1 = mol−1L s−1 Second order reaction 2 s (molL−1 )2 Identify the reaction order from each of the following rate constants. Example 3.4 (i) k = 2.3 × 10–5 L mol–1 s–1 (ii) k = 3 × 10–4 s–1 (i) The unit of second order rate constant is L mol–1 s–1, therefore Solution k = 2.3 × 10–5 L mol–1 s–1 represents a second order reaction. (ii) The unit of a first order rate constant is s–1 therefore k = 3 × 10–4 s–1  represents a first order reaction. 3.2.4 Molecularity Another property of a reaction called molecularity helps in of a understanding its mechanism.   The number of reacting species Reaction (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary reaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction. The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved, for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite. 69 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2024-25 NH NO  ® N  + 2H O 4 2 2 2 Bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide. 2HI ® H  + I 2 2 Trimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between three reacting species, for example, 2NO + O  ® 2NO 2 2 The probability that more than three molecules can collide and react simultaneously is very small.  Hence, reactions with the molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed. It is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more than one step. KClO  + 6FeSO  + 3H SO  ® KCl + 3Fe (SO ) + 3H O 3 4 2 4 2 4 3 2 This reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction, for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team depend upon the slowest person in the team.  Similarly, the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the rate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium. - 2H2O2 I   2H O + O Alkaline medium 2 2 The rate equation for this reaction is found to be dH   2ORate 2  k H   2O2 I  dt This reaction is first order with respect to both H O  and I–.  Evidences 2 2 suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps (1) H O + I– ® H O + IO– 2 2  2 (2) H O + IO– ® H O + I– + O 2 2  2 2 Both the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO- is called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being slow, is the rate determining step.  Thus, the rate of formation of intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction. Thus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following: (i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer. (ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions. For complex reaction molecularity has no meaning. Chemistry 70 Reprint 2024-25 (iii) For complex reaction, order is given by the slowest step and molecularity of the slowest step is same as the order of the overall reaction. Intext Questions 3.3 For a reaction, A + B ®  Product; the rate law is given by,  r  = k [ A]1/2 [B]2. What is the order of the reaction? 3.4 The conversion of molecules X to Y follows second order kinetics. If concentration of X is increased to three times how will it affect the rate of formation of Y ? 3 .3 Integrated We have already noted that the concentration dependence of rate is Rate called differential rate equation. It is not always convenient to determine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination Equations of slope of the tangent at point ‘t’ in concentration vs time plot (Fig. 3.1).  This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence the order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly measured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times and rate constant. The integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different reaction orders.  We shall determine these equations only for zero and first order chemical reactions. 3.3.1 Zero Order Zero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional Reactions to zero power of the concentration of reactants. Consider the reaction, R ® P d  R  Rate =  k R 0 dt As  any quantity raised to power zero is unity d  R  Rate =  k × 1 dt d[R] = – k dt Integrating both sides [R] = – k t + I (3.5) where, I is the constant of integration. At  t = 0, the concentration of the reactant R = [R] , where [R]  is 0 0 initial concentration of the reactant. Substituting in equation (3.5) [R] = –k × 0 + I 0 [R] = I 0 Substituting the value of I in the equation (3.5) [R] = -kt + [R] (3.6) 0 71 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2024-25 Comparing (3.6) with equation of a straight line, y = mx + c, if we plot [R] against t, we get a straight [R ] line (Fig. 3.3) with slope = –k and intercept equal 0 to  [R] . 0 Further simplifying equation (3.6), we get the rate k = -slope constant, k as [R ] − = [R] k 0 (3.7) t Zero order reactions are relatively uncommon but they occur under special conditions. Some enzyme catalysed reactions and reactions which occur on metal surfaces are a few examples of zero order 0 Time reactions.  The decomposition of gaseous ammonia on a hot platinum surface is a zero order reaction at Fig. 3.3: Variation in the concentration high pressure. vs time plot for a zero order reaction 2NH (g) 1130K3 → N atalyst 2 (g)+3H Pt c 2 (g) Rate = k [NH ]0 = k 3 In this reaction, platinum metal acts as a catalyst. At high pressure, the metal surface gets saturated with gas molecules. So, a further change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface is another example of zero order reaction. 3.3.2 First Order In this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the Reactions first power of the concentration of the reactant R. For example, R ® P d[R ] Rate = − = k [R ] dt d[R ] or  = –kdt [R ] Integrating this equation, we get ln [R] = – kt + I (3.8) Again, I  is the constant of integration and its value can be determined easily. When  t = 0, R = [R] , where [R]  is the initial concentration of the 0 0 reactant. Therefore, equation (3.8) can be written as ln [R]  = –k × 0 + I 0 ln [R]  =  I 0 Substituting the value of I in equation (3.8) ln[R] = –kt + ln[R] (3.9) 0 Chemistry 72 Reprint 2024-25 Concentration of R Rearranging this equation [R ] ln = −kt [R ]0 1 R  or k  ln 0 (3.10) t R  At time t from equation (3.8) 1 *ln[R]  = – kt  + *ln[R] (3.11) 1 1 0 At time t 2 ln[R]  = – kt  + ln[R] (3.12) 2 2 0 where, [R]  and [R]  are the concentrations of the reactants at time 1 2 t  and t  respectively. 1 2 Subtracting (3.12) from (3.11) ln[R] – ln[R]  = – kt – (–kt ) 1 2 1 2 [R ] ln 1 = k t2 − t [ ] ( 1) R 2 1 [R ] k = ln 1 (t ) [ 3 1 2 − t ( . 1 R ] 3) 2 Equation (3.9) can also be written as [R] ln = −kt [R ]0 Taking antilog of both sides [R] = [R]  e–kt (3.14) 0 Comparing equation (3.9) with y = mx + c, if we plot ln [R] against t (Fig. 3.4) we get a straight line with slope = –k and intercept equal to ln [R] 0 The first order rate equation (3.10) can also be written in the form 2.303 [R ] k = log 0 [ ] . t R (3 15) [R ] k * log 0 t = [R ] 2.303 If we plot a graph between log [R] /[R] vs t, (Fig. 3.5), 0 the slope = k/2.303 Hydrogenation of ethene is an example of first order reaction.
