Originally the name transition metals was derived from the fact that their chemical properties were transitional between those of s and p-block elements. Now according to IUPAC, transition metals are defined as metals which have incomplete d subshell either in neutral atom or in their ions. Zinc, cadmium and 10 mercury of group 12 have full d  configuration in their ground state as well as in their common oxidation states and hence, are not regarded as transition metals. However, being the end members of the 3d, 4d and 5d transition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied along with the chemistry of the transition metals. The presence of partly filled d or f orbitals in their atoms makes transition elements different from that of Reprint 2024-25 the non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements and their compounds are studied separately. However, the usual theory of valence as applicable to the nontransition elements can be applied successfully to the transition elements also. Various precious metals such as silver, gold and platinum and industrially important metals like iron, copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series. In this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of transition elements with special emphasis on the trends in the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals along with the preparation and properties of some important compounds. This will be followed by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals. THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK) 4. 1 Position in the The d–block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table Periodic Table flanked between s– and p– blocks in the periodic table. The d–orbitals of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to four rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d. All these series of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1. 4.2 Electronic In general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements 1– 10 1–2 is (n-1)d ns except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0. Configurations The (n–1) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten of the d-Block electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons. Elements However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very little energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. For example, consider the case of Cr, 5 1 4 2 which has 3d 4s  configuration instead of 3d 4s ; the energy gap between the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the 10 1 9 2 configuration is 3d 4s  and not 3d 4s . The ground state electronic configurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in Table 4.1.

The orbitals in these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as transition elements. The d orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules n surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given d  configuration (n = 1 – 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly filled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands. The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have been discussed in detail later in this Unit. There are greater similarities in the properties of the transition elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements. However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows (particularly 3d row) and then consider some group similarities. On what ground can you say that scandium (Z = 21) is a transition Example 4.1 element but zinc (Z = 30) is not? On the basis of incompletely filled 3d orbitals in case of scandium atom Solution 1 in its ground state (3d ), it is regarded as a transition element. On the 10 other hand, zinc atom has completely filled d orbitals (3d ) in its ground state as well as in its oxidised state, hence it is not regarded as a transition element. 91 The d- and f- Block Elements Reprint 2024-25 Intext Question 4.1 10 Silver atom has completely filled d orbitals (4d ) in its ground state. How can you say that it is a transition element? We will discuss the properties of elements of first transition series only in the following sections. 4 .3 General 4.3.1 Physical Properties Properties of Nearly all the transition elements display typical metallic properties the Transition such as high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, high thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic lustre.  With the exceptions of Zn, Elements Cd, Hg and Mn, they have one or more typical metallic structures at (d-Block) normal temperatures.

W The transition metals (with the exception Re Ta of Zn, Cd and Hg) are very hard and have low volatility. Their melting and boiling points are 3 Mo Os high. Fig. 4.1 depicts the melting points of Nb Ru transition metals belonging to 3d, 4d and 5d Ir series. The high melting points of these metals Hf Tc are attributed to the involvement of greater Cr number of electrons from (n-1)d in addition to Zr Rh 2 V Pt the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic Ti Fe Co bonding. In any row the melting points of these Pd 5 Ni metals rise to a maximum at d  except for Mn anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall Cu regularly as the atomic number increases. Au 1 Ag They have high enthalpies of atomisation which are shown in Fig. 4.2.  The maxima at about Atomic number the middle of each series indicate that one Fig. 4.1: Trends in melting points of transition elements unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly Chemistry 92 Reprint 2024-25 3 M.p./10 K favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their reactions (see later for electrode potentials). Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals. Fig. 4.2 Trends in enthalpies of atomisation of transition elements 4.3.2 Variation in In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive Atomic and decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the Ionic Sizes new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases of by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is Transition not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the Metals nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series of the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which must be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f before 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected 93 The d- and f- Block Elements Reprint 2024-25 V –1 DaH /kJ mol increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on the basis of usual family relationship. 19 The factor responsible for the lanthanoid 18 contraction is somewhat similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed 17 to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of 16 one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. However, the shielding of one 4f electron by 15 another is less than that of one d electron by 14 another, and as the nuclear charge increases 13 along the series, there is fairly regular decrease n in the size of the entire 4f  orbitals. 12 Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn The decrease in metallic radius coupled with Y Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd increase in atomic mass results in a general La Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg increase in the density of these elements. Thus, from titanium (Z = 22) to copper (Z = 29) the Fig. 4.3: Trends in atomic radii of significant increase in the density may be noted transition elements (Table 4.2).

Because of large number of unpaired electrons in their atoms they Solution have stronger interatomic interaction and hence stronger bonding between atoms resulting in higher enthalpies of atomisation. Intext Question 4.2 In the series Sc (Z = 21) to Zn (Z = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation –1 of zinc is the lowest, i.e., 126 kJ mol . Why? 4.3.3 Ionisation There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the Enthalpies transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table 4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first series of transition elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much higher along a series. The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of 3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d-block elements form ions, ns electrons are lost before (n – 1) d electrons. As we move along the period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell, i.e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly n along the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have d configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge increases because one d electron does not shield another electron from the influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction. However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both the cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at corresponding elements in the later transition series. The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic configuration dn is as follows: The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the 95 The d- and f- Block Elements Reprint 2024-25 electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in the degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of exchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3d54s1 configuration and configuration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower than Cr+. In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3d5 configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+. In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is lower than that of Mn. The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To 2+ form the M  ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy + which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M  ions 5 10 have the d  and d  configurations respectively. The value for Zn is correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s 10 electron which results in the formation of stable d  configuration. The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by the 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an 5 2+ 10 2+ electron from the d  (Mn ) and d  (Zn ) ions. In general, the third ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements. Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and not amenable to ready generalisation. 4.3.4 Oxidation One of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety States of oxidation states these may show in their compounds. Table 4.3 lists the common oxidation states of the first row transition elements. Table 4.3: Oxidation States of the first row Transition Metal (the most common ones are in bold types) Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +1 +2 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +2 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +5 +5 +5 +6 +6 +6 +7 Chemistry 96 Reprint 2024-25 The elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example, exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence (Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no d electrons are involved). The maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value IV V + to the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese (Ti O2, V O2 , V1 2– VII – Cr O4 , Mn O4 ) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of II,III higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are Fe , II,III II I,II II Co , Ni , Cu , Zn . The variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition elements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way II III that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., V , V , IV V V , V . This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit of two. An interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d– block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10). Although in the p–block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the groups of d-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO3 and WO3 are not. Low oxidation states are found when a complex compound has ligands capable of p-acceptor character in addition to the s-bonding. For example, in Ni(CO)4 and Fe(CO)5, the oxidation state of nickel and iron is zero. Name a transition element which does not exhibit variable Example 4.3 oxidation states. Scandium (Z = 21) does not exhibit variable oxidation states. Solution Intext Question 4.3 Which of the 3d series of the transition metals exhibits the largest number of oxidation states and why? 97 The d- and f- Block Elements Reprint 2024-25 4.3.5 Trends in the Table 4.4 contains the thermochemical parameters related to the 2+ 2+ M /M transformation of the solid metal atoms to M ions in solution and their V Standard standard electrode potentials. The observed values of E  and those Electrode calculated using the data of Table 4.4 are compared in Fig. 4.4. V Potentials The unique behaviour of Cu, having a positive E , accounts for its inability to liberate H2 from acids. Only oxidising acids (nitric and hot concentrated sulphuric) react with Cu, the acids being reduced. The high energy to transform Cu(s) to Cu2+(aq) is not balanced by its hydration V enthalpy. The general trend towards less negative E  values across the Fig. 4.4: Observed and calculated values for the standard electrode potentials (M2+ ® M°) of the elements Ti to Zn series is related to the general increase in the sum of the first and second V ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the value of E  for Mn, Ni and Zn are more negative than expected from the trend. 2+ 3+ 4 Why is Cr  reducing and Mn  oxidising when both have d  configuration?

The low value for Sc reflects the stability of Sc  which has a Standard noble gas configuration. The highest value for Zn is due to the removal 10 2+ Electrode of an electron from the stable d  configuration of Zn . The 2+ 5 Potentials comparatively high value for Mn shows that Mn (d ) is particularly stable, whereas comparatively low value for Fe shows the extra stability 3+ 5 of Fe  (d ). The comparatively low value for V is related to the stability 2+ of V  (half-filled t2g level, Unit 5). 4.3.7 Trends in Table 4.5 shows the stable halides of the 3d series of transition metals. Stability of The highest oxidation numbers are achieved in TiX4 (tetrahalides), VF5 Higher and CrF6. The +7 state for Mn is not represented in simple halides but Oxidation MnO3F is known, and beyond Mn no metal has a trihalide except FeX3 States and CoF3. The ability of fluorine to stabilise the highest oxidation state is due to either higher lattice energy as in the case of CoF3, or higher bond enthalpy terms for the higher covalent compounds, e.g., VF5 and CrF6. +5 Although V  is represented only by VF5, the other halides, however, undergo hydrolysis to give oxohalides, VOX3. Another feature of fluorides is their instability in the low oxidation states e.g., VX2 (X = CI, Br or I) Table 4.5: Formulas of Halides of 3d Metals Oxidation Number + 6 CrF6 + 5 VF5 CrF5 + 4 TiX4 VXI 4 CrX4 MnF4 + 3 TiX3 VX3 CrX3 MnF3 FeXI 3 CoF3 III II + 2 TiX2 VX2 CrX2 MnX2 FeX2 CoX2 NiX2 CuX2 ZnX2 III + 1 CuX Key: X = F ® I; XI = F ® Br; XII = F, CI; XIII = CI ® I 99 The d- and f- Block Elements Reprint 2024-25 II and the same applies to CuX. On the other hand, all Cu  halides are 2+ – known except the iodide. In this case, Cu  oxidises I  to I2: 2Cu2  4I  Cu2I2 s  I2 However, many copper (I) compounds are unstable in aqueous solution and undergo disproportionation. + 2+ 2Cu  ® Cu  + Cu 2+ + The stability of Cu  (aq) rather than Cu (aq) is due to the much 2 more negative DhydH o + + of Cu  (aq) than Cu , which more than compensates for the second ionisation enthalpy of Cu. The ability of oxygen to stabilise the highest oxidation state is demonstrated in the oxides. The highest oxidation number in the oxides (Table 4.6) coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc2O3 to Mn2O7. Beyond Group 7, no higher oxides of Fe above Fe2O3, are 2– known, although ferrates (VI)(FeO4) , are formed in alkaline media but they readily decompose to Fe2O3 and O2. Besides the oxides, oxocations v + IV 2+ IV 2+ stabilise V  as VO2 , V as VO  and Ti  as TiO . The ability of oxygen to stabilise these high oxidation states exceeds that of fluorine. Thus the highest Mn fluoride is MnF4 whereas the highest oxide is Mn2O7. The ability of oxygen to form multiple bonds to metals explains its superiority. In the covalent oxide Mn2O7, each Mn is tetrahedrally n- surrounded by O’s including a Mn–O–Mn bridge. The tetrahedral [MO4] V Vl V Vl VII ions are known for V , Cr , Mn , Mn  and Mn .

Intext Question 4.5 How would you account for the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies (first and second) in the first series of the transition elements? Chemistry 100 Reprint 2024-25 4.3.8 Chemical Transition metals vary widely in their chemical reactivity. Many of Reactivity them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although and Eo a few are ‘noble’—that is, they are unaffected by single acids. Values The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively more reactive and are oxidised by 1M H+, though the actual rate at + which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion (H ) is sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The o E  values for M2+/M (Table 4.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent cations across the series. This general trend towards less negative o E values is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the o E  values for Mn, Ni and Zn are more negative than expected from the general trend. 5 2+ Whereas the stabilities of half-filled d subshell (d ) in Mn  and completely 10 e filled d subshell (d ) in zinc are related to their E  values; for nickel, o E value is related to the highest negative enthalpy of hydration. 3+ 2+ An examination of the o E  values for the redox couple M /M  (Table 3+ 3+ 4.2) shows that Mn  and Co  ions are the strongest oxidising agents 2+ 2+ 2+ in aqueous solutions. The ions Ti , V  and Cr are strong reducing agents and will liberate hydrogen from a dilute acid, e.g., 2+ + 3+ 2 Cr (aq) + 2 H (aq) ® 2 Cr (aq) + H2(g) Example 4.6 For the first row transition metals the o E values are: o E V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu 2+ (M /M) –1.18 – 0.91 –1.18 – 0.44 – 0.28 – 0.25 +0.34 Explain the irregularity in the above values. Solution The o 2+ E  (M /M) values are not regular which can be explained from the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies (iH1  iH2 ) and also the sublimation enthalpies which are relatively much less for manganese and vanadium. Example 4.7 Why is the o 3+ 2+ E  value for the Mn /Mn  couple much more positive 3+ 2+ 3+ 2+ than that for Cr /Cr  or Fe /Fe ? Explain. Solution Much larger third ionisation energy of Mn (where the required change 5 4 is d  to d ) is mainly responsible for this. This also explains why the +3 state of Mn is of little importance. Intext Questions 4.6 Why is the highest oxidation state of a metal exhibited in its oxide or fluoride only? 2+ 2+ 4.7 Which is a stronger reducing agent Cr  or Fe  and why ? 4.3.9 Magnetic When a magnetic field is applied to substances, mainly two types of Properties magnetic behaviour are observed: diamagnetism and paramagnetism. Diamagnetic substances are repelled by the applied field while the paramagnetic substances are attracted. Substances which are 101 The d- and f- Block Elements Reprint 2024-25 attracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact, ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the
