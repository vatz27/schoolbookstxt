In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This will be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution. 1 . 1 Types of Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two Solutions components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent. Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or more components present in the  solution other than solvent are called solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e., Reprint 2024-25 consisting of two components). Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1. Table 1.1: Types of Solutions Type of Solution Solute Solvent Common Examples Gaseous Solutions Gas Gas Mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gases Liquid Gas Chloroform mixed with nitrogen gas Solid Gas Camphor in nitrogen gas Liquid Solutions Gas Liquid Oxygen dissolved in water Liquid Liquid Ethanol dissolved in water Solid Liquid Glucose dissolved in water Solid Solutions Gas Solid Solution of hydrogen in palladium Liquid Solid Amalgam of mercury with sodium Solid Solid Copper dissolved in gold Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its 1 .2 Expressing concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively Concentration or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the of Solutions solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution. There are several ways by which we can describe the concentration of the solution quantitatively. (i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as: Mass % of a component Mass of the component in the solution = 100 (1.1) Total mass of the solution For example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by mass, it means that 10 g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water resulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications. For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water. (ii) Volume percentage (V/V): The volume percentage is defined as: Volume of  the component Volume % of a component = 100 Total volume of  solution (1.2) Chemistry 2 Reprint 2024-25 For example, 10% ethanol solution in water means that 10 mL of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of the solution is 100 mL. Solutions containing liquids are commonly expressed in this unit. For example, a 35% (v/v) solution of ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing point of water to 255.4K (–17.6°C). (iii) Mass by volume percentage (w/V): Another unit which is commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in 100 mL of the solution. (iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm) and is defined as: Parts per million = Number of  parts of  the component ×106 (1.3) Total number of parts of  all components of the solution As in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to volume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about –3 6 × 10  g of dissolved oxygen (O2). Such a small concentration is 6 also expressed as 5.8 g per 10  g (5.8 ppm) of sea water. The concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed – in terms of m 1 g mL  or ppm. (v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is x and subscript used on the right hand side of x denotes the component. It is defined as: Mole fraction of a component = Number of  moles of  the component (1.4) Total number of  moles of  all the components For example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are nA and nB respectively, the mole fraction of A will be n x A A = (1.5) n A   nB For a solution containing i number of components, we have: n  n xi = i   = i (1.6) n1   n 2  .......  n i  n i It can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole fractions is unity, i.e. x1 + x2 + .................. + xi = 1 (1.7) Mole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties of solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the solution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving gas mixtures. 3 Solutions Reprint 2024-25 Example 1.1 Calculate the mole fraction of ethylene glycol (C H O ) in a solution 2 6 2 containing 20% of C H O  by mass. 2 6 2 Solution Assume that we have 100 g of solution (one can start with any amount of solution because the results obtained will be the same). Solution will contain 20 g of ethylene glycol and 80 g of water. Molar mass of C H O  = 12 × 2 + 1 × 6 + 16 × 2 = 62 g mol–1. 2 6 2 20 g Moles of C H O  =  0.322 mol 2 6 2 62 g mol1 = 80 g Moles of water = -1  = 4.444 mol 18 g mol moles of C H O x ycol  2 6 2 gl moles of C2H6O2  moles of H2O 0.322mol    =  0.068 0.322mol 4.444 mol 4.444 mol Similarly, x water   0.932 0.322 mol   4.444 mol Mole fraction of water can also be calculated as: 1 – 0.068 = 0.932 (vi) Molarity: Molarity (M) is defined as number of moles of solute dissolved in one litre (or one cubic decimetre) of solution, Moles of solute Molarity  (1.8) Volume of solution in litre For example, 0.25 mol L–1 (or 0.25 M) solution of NaOH means that 0.25 mol of NaOH has been dissolved in one litre (or one cubic decimetre). Example 1.2 Calculate the molarity of a solution containing 5 g of NaOH in 450 mL solution. Solution 5 g Moles of NaOH =  = 0.125 mol 40 g mol-1 Volume of the solution in litres = 450 mL / 1000 mL L-1 Using equation (2.8), 0.125 mol × 1000 mL L–1 Molarity =  = 0.278 M 450 mL = 0.278 mol L–1 = 0.278 mol dm–3 Chemistry 4 Reprint 2024-25 (vii) Molality: Molality (m) is defined as the number of moles of the solute per kilogram (kg) of the solvent and is expressed as: Moles of solute Molality (m) = (1.9) Mass of solvent in kg –1 For example, 1.00 mol kg  (or 1.00 m) solution of KCl means that 1 mol (74.5 g) of KCl is dissolved in 1 kg of water. Each method of expressing concentration of the solutions has its own merits and demerits. Mass %, ppm, mole fraction and molality are independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of temperature. This is because volume depends on temperature and the mass does not. Calculate molality of 2.5 g of ethanoic acid (CH COOH) in 75 g of benzene.

It depends upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid or a gas in a liquid. 5 Solutions Reprint 2024-25 1.3.1 Solubility of Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride a Solid in a and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do Liquid not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in nonpolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like dissolves like. When a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going into solution  will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. Solute + Solvent ⇌  Solution (1.10) At this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility. Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon. Effect of temperature The solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This, being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is endothermic (Dsol H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in temperature and if it is exothermic (Dsol H < 0) the solubility should decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally. Effect of pressure Pressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure. 1.3.2 Solubility of Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent a Gas in a in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On Liquid the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water. Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and Chemistry 6 Reprint 2024-25 temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure. For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous system at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the solution and thus its solubility increases. Henry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as Henry’s law. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also Fig. 1.1: Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas. The concluded independently that the concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the solubility of a gas in a liquid pressure on the gas above the solution. solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry’s law states that “the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas (x) in the solution” and is expressed as: p = KH x (1.11) Here K  is the Henry’s law constant. If we draw a H graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2. Different gases have different K  values at the same H temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that K  is a H function of the nature of the gas. It is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the Fig. 1.2: Experimental results for the solubility of HCl gas in value of K  at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility H cyclohexane at 293 K. The of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1.2 slope of the line is the that K  values for both N  and O  increase with increase H 2 2 Henry’s Law constant, K . of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases H 7 Solutions Reprint 2024-25 Table 1.2: Values of Henry's Law Constant for Some Selected Gases in Water Gas Temperature/K K  /kbar Gas Temperature/K K /kbar H H He 293 144.97 Argon 298 40.3 H 293 69.16 2 CO 298 1.67 2 N 293 76.48 2 Formaldehyde 298 1.83×10-5 N 303 88.84 2 O 293 34.86 Methane 298 0.413 2 O 303 46.82 2 Vinyl chloride 298 0.611 increases with decrease of temperature. It is due to this reason that aquatic species are more comfortable in cold waters rather than in warm waters. Example 1.4 If N  gas is bubbled through water at 293 K, how many millimoles of N 2 2 gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water? Assume that N  exerts a partial 2 pressure of 0.987 bar. Given that Henry’s law constant for N  at 293 K is 2 76.48 kbar. Solution The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution. The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying Henry’s law. Thus: p  (nitrogen) 0.987bar x (Nitrogen)  =   =  = 1.29  10–5 × KH 76,480 bar As 1 litre of water contains 55.5 mol of it, therefore if n represents number of moles of N  in solution, 2 n  mol n x (Nitrogen) =  =  = 1.29 × 10–5 n  mol + 55.5 mol  55.5 (n in denominator is neglected as it is < < 55.5) Thus n = 1.29 –5 × 10  × 55.5 mol = 7.16 × 10–4 mol 7.16×104  mol × 1000 mmol =  = 0.716 mmol 1 mol Henry’s law finds several applications in industry and explains some biological phenomena. Notable among these are: · To increase the solubility of CO  in soft drinks and soda water, the 2 bottle is sealed under high pressure. · Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. When the divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life. Chemistry 8 Reprint 2024-25 To avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air diluted with helium (11.7% helium, 56.2% nitrogen and 32.1% oxygen). · At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia. Effect of Temperature Solubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. When dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must follow Le Chatelier’s Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic process, the solubility should decrease with increase of temperature. Intext Questions 1.6 H S, a toxic gas with rotten egg like smell, is used for the qualitative analysis. If 2 the solubility of H S in water at STP is 0.195 m, calculate Henry’s law constant. 2 1.7 Henry’s law constant for CO  in water is 1.67×108 Pa at 298 K. Calculate 2 the quantity of CO  in 500 mL of soda water when packed under 2.5 atm 2 CO  pressure at 298 K. 2 1 .4 Vapour Liquid solutions are formed when solvent is a liquid. The solute can be Pressure of a gas, a liquid or a solid. Solutions of gases in liquids have already Liquid been discussed in Section 1.3.2. In this Section, we shall discuss the solutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain Solutions one or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile. The solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two components, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (ii) solids in liquids. 1.4.1 Vapour Let us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the Pressure of two components as 1 and 2. When taken in a closed vessel, both the Liquid- components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be Liquid established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total Solutions vapour pressure at this stage be p and p  and p  be the partial total 1 2 vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These partial pressures are related to the mole fractions x  and x  of the two 1 2 components 1 and 2 respectively. The French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as the Raoult’s law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids, 9 Solutions Reprint 2024-25 the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution. Thus, for component 1 p  µ x 1 1 and      p =  p0  x (1.12) 1 1 1 where p0  is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same 1 temperature. Similarly, for component 2 p  = p 0 x (1.13) 2 2 2 0 where p2  represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2. According to Dalton’s law of partial pressures, the total pressure ( ptotal ) over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as: p = p  + p (1.14) total 1 2 Substituting the values of p1 and p2, we get p = x  p 0 + x  p 0 total 1 1 2 2 = (1 – x ) p 0 + x  p 0 (1.15) 2 1 2 2 = p 0 + (p 0 – p 0) x (1.16) 1 2 1 2 Following conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16). (i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole fraction of any one component. (ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2. (iii) Depending on the vapour pressures of the pure components 1 and 2, total vapour pressure over the solution decreases or increases with the increase of the mole fraction of component 1. A plot of p1 or p2 versus the mole fractions x1 and x2 for a solution gives a linear plot as shown in Fig. 1.3. These lines (I and II) pass through the points for which x1 and x2 are equal to unity. Similarly the plot (line III) of ptotal versus x2 is also linear (Fig. 1.3). The minimum 0 value of ptotal is p1  and the maximum value Fig. 1.3: The plot of  vapour pressure and mole 0 is p2 , assuming that component 1 is less fraction of an ideal solution at constant 0 0 volatile than component 2,  i.e., p1 < p temperature. The dashed lines I and II 2 . represent the partial pressure of the The composition of vapour phase in components. (It can be seen from the plot equilibrium with the solution is determined that p1 and p2 are directly proportional to x by the partial pressures of the components. 1 and x2, respectively). The total vapour If y  and y  are the mole fractions of the 1 2 pressure is given by line marked III in the figure. Chemistry 10 Reprint 2024-25 components 1 and 2 respectively in the vapour phase then, using Dalton’s law of partial pressures: p1 = y1 ptotal (1.17) p2 = y2 ptotal (1.18) In general pi = yi  ptotal (1.19) Vapour pressure of chloroform (CHCl ) and dichloromethane (CH Cl ) Example 1.5 3 2 2 at 298 K are 200 mm Hg and 415 mm Hg respectively. (i) Calculate the vapour pressure of the solution prepared by mixing 25.5 g of CHCl  and 40 g of CH Cl  at 298 K and, (ii) mole fractions of each 3 2 2 component in vapour phase. Solution (i) Molar mass of CH Cl = 12 × 1 + 1 × 2 + 35.5 × 2 = 85 g mol–1 2 2 Molar mass of CHCl = 12 × 1 + 1 × 1 + 35.5 × 3 = 119.5 g mol-1 3 40 g Moles of CH Cl = 2 85 g mol1  = 0.47 mol 2 25.5 g Moles of CHCl = 3 119.5 g mol1  = 0.213 mol Total number of moles = 0.47 + 0.213 = 0.683 mol 0.47 mol xCH2Cl  = = 0.688 2 0.683 mol xCHCl  = 1.00 – 0.688 = 0.312 3 Using equation (2.16), ptota = p 0 l  + (p 0 – p 0) x  = 200 + (415 – 200) × 0.688 1 2 1 2 = 200 + 147.9 = 347.9 mm Hg (ii) Using the relation (2.19), yi = pi/ptotal, we can calculate the mole fraction of the components in gas phase (yi). pCH Cl = 0.688 × 415 mm Hg = 285.5 mm Hg 2 2 pCHCl = 0.312 × 200 mm Hg = 62.4 mm Hg 3 yCH2Cl = 285.5 mm Hg/347.9 mm Hg = 0.82 2 yCHCl = 62.4 mm Hg/347.9 mm Hg = 0.18 3 Note: Since, CH Cl  is a more volatile component than CHCl , [ p0 2 2 3 CH2Cl = 2 415 mm Hg and p0 CHCl = 200 mm Hg] and the vapour phase is also richer 3 in CH Cl  [y n 2 CH 8 2Cl = 0. 2 a d y 2 2 CHCl = 0.18], it may thus be concluded 3 that at equilibrium, vapour phase will be always rich in the component which is more volatile. 11 Solutions Reprint 2024-25 1.4.2 Raoult’s According to Raoult’s law, the vapour pressure of a volatile component Law as a in a given solution is given by p  = x  0 p . In the solution of a gas in a i i i special case liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and of Henry’s we have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry’s law which Law states that p = KH x. If we compare the equations for Raoult’s law and Henry’s law, it can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the 0 proportionality constant KH differs from p1 . Thus, Raoult’s law becomes 0 a special case of Henry’s law in which KH becomes equal to p1 . 1.4.3 Vapour Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in Pressure of liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in Solutions of water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some Solids in physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of Liquids pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given temperature vapourise and under equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)]. In a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In Fig. 1.4: Decrease in the vapour pressure of the the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent on account of the  presence of solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the solute in the solvent (a) evaporation of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets molecules of the solvent from its surface reduced. Consequently, the number of is denoted by , (b) in a solution, solute solvent molecules escaping from the surface particles have been denoted by  and they is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour also occupy part of the surface area. pressure is also reduced. The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. Raoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p1 be Chemistry 12 Reprint 2024-25 the vapour pressure of the solvent, x1 be 0 its mole fraction, pi  be its vapour pressure in the pure state. Then according to Raoult’s law Fig. 1.5 p1 µ x1 If a solution obeys Raoult's law for all and p1 = x1 p0 (1.20) 1 concentrations, its The proportionality constant is equal vapour pressure to the vapour pressure of pure solvent, p0 would vary linearly . 1 from zero to the A plot between the vapour pressure and vapour pressure of the mole fraction of the solvent is linear the pure solvent. (Fig. 1.5). 1 .5 Ideal and Non- Liquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal ideal Solutions solutions on the basis of Raoult’s law. 1.5.1 Ideal The solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of Solutions concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i.e., DmixH = 0, DmixV = 0 (1.21) It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category. 1.5.2 Non-ideal When a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of Solutions concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult’s law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6. The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules
