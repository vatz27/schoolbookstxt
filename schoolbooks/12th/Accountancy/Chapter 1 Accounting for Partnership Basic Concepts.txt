Section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 defines partnership as the 2024-25 2 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts ‘relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all’. Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are individually called ‘partners’ and collectively called ‘firm’. The name under which the business is carried is called the ‘firm’s name’. A partnership firm has no separate legal entity, apart from the partners constituting it. Thus, the essential features of partnership are: 1. Two or More Persons: In order to form partnership, there should be at least two persons coming together for a common goal. In other words, the minimum number of partners in a firm can be two. There is however, a limit on their maximum number. By virtue of Section 464 of the Companies Act 2013, the Central Government is empowered to prescribe maximum number of partners in a firm but the number of partners can not be more than 100. The Central government has prescribed the maximum number of partness in a firm to be 50. 2. Agreement: Partnership is the result of an agreement between two or more persons to do business and share its profits and losses. The agreement becomes the basis of relationship between the partners. It is not necessary that such agreement is in written form. An oral agreement is equally valid. But in order to avoid disputes, it is preferred that the partners have a written agreement. 3. Business: The agreement should be to carry on some business. Mere coownership of a property does not amount to partnership. For example, if Rohit and Sachin jointly purchase a plot of land, they become the joint owners of the property and not the partners. But if they are in the business of purchase and sale of land for the purpose of making profit, they will be called partners. 4. Mutual Agency: The business of a partnership concern may be carried on by all the partners or any of them acting for all. This statement has two important implications. First, every partner is entitled to participate in the conduct of the affairs of its business. Second, that there exists a relationship of mutual agency between all the partners. Each partner carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the other partners. He can bind other partners by his acts and also is bound by the acts of other partners with regard to business of the firm. Relationship of mutual agency is so important that one can say that there would be no partnership, if the element of mutual agency is absent. 5. Sharing of Profit: Another important element of partnership is that, the agreement between partners must be to share profits and losses of a business. Though the definition contained in the Partnership Act describes partnership as relation between people who agree to share the profits of a business, the sharing of loss is implied. Thus, sharing of profits and 2024-25 Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts 3 losses is important. If some persons join hands for the purpose of some charitable activity, it will not be termed as partnership. 6. Liability of Partners: Each partner is liable jointly with all the other partners and also severally to the third party for all the acts of the firm done while he is a partner. Not only that the liability of a partner for acts of the firm is also unlimited. This implies that his private assets can also be used for paying off the firm’s debts. 1.2 Partnership Deed Partnership comes into existence as a result of agreement among the partners. The agreement can be either oral or written. The Partnership Act does not require that the agreement must be in writing. But wherever it is in writing, the document, which contains terms of the agreement  is called ‘Partnership Deed’. It generally contains the details about all the aspects affecting the relationship between the partners including the objective of business, contribution of capital by each partner, ratio in which the profits and the losses will be shared by the partners and entitlement of partners to interest on capital, interest on loan, etc. The clauses of partnership deed can be altered with the consent of all the partners. The deed should be properly drafted and prepared as per the provisions of the ‘Stamp Act’ and preferably registered with the Registrar of Firms. Contents of the Partnership Deed The Partnership Deed usually contains the following details: • Names and Addresses of the firm and its main business; • Names and Addresses of all partners; • Amount of capital to be contributed by each partner; • The accounting period of the firm; • The date of commencement of partnership; • Rules regarding operation of Bank Accounts; • Profit and loss sharing ratio; • Rate of interest on capital, loan, drawings, etc; • Mode of auditor’s appointment, if any; • Salaries, commission, etc, if payable to any partner; • The rights, duties and liabilities of each partner; • Treatment of loss arising out of insolvency of one or more partners; • Settlement of accounts on dissolution of the firm; • Method of settlement of disputes among the partners; • Rules to be followed in case of admission, retirement, death of a partner; and • Any other matter relating to the conduct of business. Normally, the partnership deed covers all matters affecting relationship of partners amongst themselves. However, if there is no express agreement on certain matters, the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall apply. 2024-25 4 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts 1.2.1 Provisions of Partnership Act Relevant for Accounting The important provisions affecting partnership accounts are as follows: (a) Profit Sharing Ratio: If the partnership deed is silent about the profit sharing ratio, the profits and losses of the firm are to be shared equally by partners, irrespective of their capital contribution in the firm. (b) Interest on Capital: No partner is entitled to claim any interest on the amount of capital contributed by him in the firm as a matter of right. However, interest can be allowed when it is expressly agreed to by the partners. Thus, no interest on capital is payable if the partnership deed is silent on the issue. (c) Interest on Drawings: No interest is to be charged on the drawings made by the partners, if there is no mention in the Deed. (d) Interest on Loan: If any partner has advanced loan to the firm for the purpose of business, he/she shall be entitled to get an interest on the loan amount at the rate of 6 per  cent per annum. (e) Remuneration for Firm’s Work: No partner is entitled to get salary or other remuneration for taking part in the conduct of the business of the firm unless there is a provision for the same in the Partnership Deed. Apart from the above, the Indian Partnership Act specifies that subject to contract between the partners: (i) If a partner derives any profit for him/her self from any transaction of the firm or from the use of the property or business connection of the firm or the firm name, he/she shall account for the profit and pay it to the firm. (ii) If a partner carries on any business of the same nature as and competing with that of the firm, he/she shall account for and pay to the firm, all profit made by him/her in that business. Test your Understanding – I 1. Mohan and Shyam are partners in a firm. State whether the claim is valid if the partnership agreement is silent in the following matters: (i) Mohan is an active partner. He wants a salary of Rs. 10,000 per year; (ii) Shyam had advanced a loan to the firm. He claims interest @ 10% per annum; (iii) Mohan has contributed Rs. 20,000 and Shyam Rs. 50,000 as capital. Mohan wants equal share in profits. (iv) Shyam wants interest on capital to be credited @ 6% per annum. 2. State whether the following statements are true or false: (i) Valid partnership can be formulated even without a written agreement between the partners; (ii) Each partner carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the other partners; (iii) Maximum number of partners can be 50; (iv) Methods of settlement of dispute among the partners can’t be part of the partnership deed; 2024-25 Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts 5 (v) If the deed is silent, interest at the rate of 6% p.a. would be charged on the drawings made by the partner; (vi) Interest on partner’s loan is to be given @ 12% p.a., if the deed is silent about the rate. 1.3 Special Aspects of Partnership Accounts Accounting treatment for partnership firm is similar to that of a sole proprietorship business with the exception of the following aspects: • Maintenance of Partners’ Capital Accounts; • Distribution of Profit and Loss among the partners; • Adjustments for Wrong Appropriation of Profits in the Past; • Reconstitution of the Partnership Firm; and • Dissolution of Partnership Firm. The first three aspects mentioned above have been taken up in the following sections of this chapter. The remaining aspects have been covered in the subsequent chapters. 1.4 Maintenance of Capital Accounts of Partners All transactions relating to partners of the firm are recorded in the books of the firm through their capital accounts. This includes the amount of money brought in as capital, withdrawal of capital, share of profit, interest on capital, interest on drawings, partner’s salary, commission to partners, etc. There are two methods by which the capital accounts of partners can be maintained. These are: (i) fixed capital method, and (ii) fluctuating capital method. The difference between the two lies in whether or not the transactions other than addition/withdrawal of capital are recorded in the capital accounts of the partners. (a) Fixed Capital Method: Under the fixed capital method, the capitals of the partners shall remain fixed unless additional capital is introduced or a part of the capital is withdrawn as per the agreement among the partners. All items like share of profit or loss, interest on capital, drawings, interest on drawings, etc. are recorded in a separate accounts, called Partner’s Current Account. The partners’ capital accounts will always show a credit balance, which shall remain the same (fixed) year after year unless there is any addition or withdrawal of capital. The partners’ current account on the other hand, may show a debit or a credit balance. Thus under this method, two accounts are maintained for each partner viz., capital account and current account, While the partners’ capital accounts shall always appear on the liabilities side in the balance sheet, the partners’ current account’s balance shall be shown on the liabilities side, if they have credit balance and on the assets side, if they have debit balance. The partner’s capital account and the current account under the fixed capital method would appear as shown in Fig.1.1. 2024-25 6 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts Partner’s Capital Account Dr. Cr.

(b) Fluctuating Capital Method: Under the fluctuating capital method, only one account, i.e. capital account is maintained for each partner. All the adjustments such as share of profit and loss, interest on capital, drawings, interest on drawings, salary or commission to partners, etc are recorded directly in the capital accounts of the partners. This makes the balance in the capital account to fluctuate from time to time. That’s the reason why this method is called fluctuating capital method. In the absence of any instruction, the capital account should be prepared by this method. The proforma of capital accounts prepared under the fluctuating capital method is given in Fig.1.2. 2024-25 Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts 7 Partner’s Capital Account Dr. Cr.

(ii) Items related Drawings, salary,interest All adjustments for drawings, to deed on capital,etc. are posted salary interest on capital, etc., (transfered) in the current are posted (transfered) in the accounts and not in the capital accounts, capital accounts. (iii) Fixed balance The capital account balance The balance of the capital remain unchanged unless account fluctuates from year there is addition to or to year withdrawal of capital. (iv) Credit balance The capital accounts The capital account always show a credit balance. may sometimes show a debit balance. 2024-25 8 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts 1.5 Distribution of Profit among Partners The profits and losses of the firm are distributed among the partners in an agreed ratio. However, if the partnership deed is silent, the firm’s profits and losses are to be shared equally by all the partners. You know that in the case of sole partnership the profit or loss, as ascertained by the profit and loss account is transferred to the capital account of the proprietor. In case of partnership, however, certain adjustments such as interest on drawings, interest on capital, salary to partners, and commission to partners are required to be made. For this purpose, it is customary to prepare a Profit and Loss Appropriation Account of the firm and ascertain the final figure of profit and loss to be distributed among the partners, in their profit sharing ratio. 1.5.1 Profit and Loss Appropriation Account Profit and Loss Appropriation Account is merely an extension of the Profit and Loss Account of the firm. It shows how the profits are appropriated or distributed among the partners. All adjustments in respect of partner’s salary, partner’s commission, interest on capital, interest on drawings, etc. are made through this account. It starts with the net profit/net loss as per Profit and Loss Account. The journal entries for preparation of Profit and Loss Appropriation Account and making various adjustments through it are given as follows: Journal Entries 1.
