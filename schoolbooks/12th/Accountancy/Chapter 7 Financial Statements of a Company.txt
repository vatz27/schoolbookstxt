144 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements Financial Statements of a Company 3 Having understood how a company raises its capital, we have to learn the nature, objectives and types of financial statements it has to prepare including their contents, format, uses and limitations. The financial statements are the end products of accounting process. They are prepared following accounting policies consistently accounting standards prescribed in the Companies Act and accounting concepts, principles, procedures and also the legal environment in which the business organisations operate. These LEARNING OBJECTIVES statements are the outcome of the summarising After studying this chapter, process of accounting and are, therefore, the you will be able to : sources of information on the basis of which • explain the nature and conclusions are drawn about the profitability and objectives of financial the financial position of a company.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants states the nature of financial statements as, “the statements prepared for the purpose of presenting a periodical review of report on progress by the management and deal with the status of investment in the business and the results achieved during the period under review. They reflect a combination of recorded facts, accounting principles and personal judgements”. The following points explain the nature of financial statements: 1. Recorded Facts: Financial statements are prepared on the basis of facts in the form of cost data recorded in accounting books. The original cost or historical cost is the basis of recording transactions. The figures of various accounts such as cash in hand, cash at bank, trade receivables, fixed assets, etc., are taken as per the figures recorded in the accounting books. The assets purchased at different times and at different prices are put together and shown at costs. As these are not based on market prices, the financial statements do not show current financial condition of the concern. 2. Accounting Conventions: Certain accounting conventions are followed while preparing financial statements. The convention of valuing inventory at cost or market price, whichever is lower, is followed. The valuing of assets at cost less depreciation principle for balance sheet purposes is followed. The convention of materiality is followed in dealing with small items like pencils, pens, postage stamps, etc. These items are treated as expenditure in the year in which they are purchased even though they are assets in nature. The stationery is valued at cost and not on the principle of cost or market price, whichever is less. The use of accounting conventions makes financial statements comparable, simple and realistic. 3. Postulates: Financial statements are prepared on certain basic assumptions (pre-requisites) known as postulates such as going concern postulate, money measurement postulate, realisation postulate, etc. Going concern postulate assumes that the enterprise is treated as a going concern and exists for a longer period of time. So the assets are shown on historical cost basis. Money measurement postulate assumes that the value of money will remain the same in different periods. Though there is drastic change in purchasing power of money, the assets purchased at different times will be shown at 2024-25 146 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements the amount paid for them. While, preparing statement of profit and loss the revenue is included in the sales of the year in which the sale was undertaken even though the sale price may be received over a number of years. The assumption is known as realisation postulate. 4. Personal Judgements: Under more than one circumstance, facts and figures presented through financial statements are based on personal opinion, estimates and judgements. The depreciation is provided taking into consideration the useful economic life of fixed assets. Provisions for doubtful debts are made on estimates and personal judgements. In valuing inventory, cost or market value, whichever is less is being followed. While deciding either cost of inventory or market value of inventory, many personal judgements are to be made based on certain considerations. Personal opinion, judgements and estimates are made while preparing the financial statements to avoid any possibility of over statement of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure, keeping in mind the convention of conservatism. Thus, financial statements are the summarised reports of recorded facts and are prepared the following accounting concepts, conventions, accounting policies, accounting standards and requirements of Law. 3.3 Objectives of Financial Statements Financial statements are the basic sources of information to the shareholders and other external parties for understanding the profitability and financial position of any business concern. They provide information about the results of the business concern during a specified period of time in terms of assets and liabilities, which provide the basis for taking decisions. Thus, the primary objective of financial statements is to assist the users in their decision-making. The specific objectives include the following: 1. To provide information about economic resources and obligations of a business: They are prepared to provide adequate, reliable and periodical information about economic resources and obligations of a business firm to investors and other external parties who have limited authority, ability or resources to obtain information. 2. To provide information about the earning capacity of the business: They are to provide useful financial information which can gainfully be utilised to predict, compare and evaluate the business firm’s earning capacity. 3. To provide information about cash flows: They are to provide information useful to investors and creditors for predicting, comparing and evaluating, potential cash flows in terms of amount, timing and related uncertainties. 2024-25 Financial Statements of a Company 147 4. To judge effectiveness of management: They supply information useful for judging management’s ability to utilise the resources of a business effectively. 5. Information about activities of business affecting the society: They have to report the activities of the business organisation affecting the society, which can be determined and described or measured and which are important in its social environment. 6. Disclosing accounting policies: These reports have to provide the significant policies, concepts followed in the process of accounting and changes taken up in them during the year to understand these statements in a better way. 3.4 Types of Financial Statements The financial statements generally include two statements: balance sheet and statement of profit and loss which are required for external reporting and also for internal needs of the management like planning, decision-making and control. Apart from these, there is also a need to know about movements of funds and changes in the financial position of the company. For this purpose, a cash flow statement is prepard. Every company registered under The Companies Act 2013 shall prepare its balance sheet, statement of profit and loss and notes to account thereto in accordance with the manner prescribed in the revised Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 to harmonise the disclosure requirement with the accounting standards and to converge with new reforms.

They should be written-off first from securities premium and the balance if any, from statement of profit & loss.  Borrowing costs such as discount on issue of debentures should be written-off in the same year in which debuntures are issued. Share application money pending allotment Share application money not exceeding the issued capital and to the extent non-refundable shall be classified as non-current. It will be shown on this face of balance sheet as share application money pending allotment. Borrowings Total borrowings are categorised into long-term borrowings, short-term borrowings and current maturities to long-term debt. (i) Loans which are repayable in more than twelve months/operating cycle are classified as long-term borrowings on the face of balance sheet. (ii) Loans repayable on demand or whose original tenure is not more than twelve months/operating cycle are classified as short-term borrowings on the face of balance sheet. 2024-25 Financial Statements of a Company 155 (iii) Current maturities to long-term loan include amount repayable within twelve months/operating cycle under other current liabilities with Note to Account. Deferred tax assets/liabilities are always non-current. This is in accordance with Schedule III of the Companies Act. Trade payables Sundry creditors have been replaced with the term Trade payables and are classified as current and non-current. Trade payables to be settled beyond 12 months from the date of balance sheet or beyond the operating cycle are classified under “other long-term liabilities” with Note to Account. For example, purchase of goods and services in normal course of business. The balance of trade payables are classified as current liabilities on the face of balance sheet. Proposed Dividend Proposed dividend is proposed by the Board of Directors and declared (approved) by the shareholders in their Annual General Meeting. Board of Directors propose the dividend after the annual accounts for the year have been prepared. Annual General Meeting of the shareholders is held thereafter meaning it is held in the next financial year. Shareholders may reduce the amount of proposed dividend but cannot increase it. Since declaration of proposed (final) dividend is contingent upon shareholders approval, Proposed dividend is shown as contingent liability. AS-4, Contingencies and Events Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date prescribes that proposed dividend will be shown in the Notes to Accounts. After the Proposed dividend is declared by the shareholders, it becomes a liability for the company and is accounted in the books. As a consequence, proposed dividend of previous year will be declared (approved) by the shareholders in the current year and this declared (approved) proposed dividend will be accounted during the year. Proposed dividend for the current year will be relevant for the next financial year. Briefly, proposed dividend of previous year will be accounted in the current year after it is declared (approved) by the shareholders in their annual general meeting. Provisions The amount of provision settled within 12 months from balance sheet date or within operating cycle period from date of its recognition is classified as short term provisions and shown under current liabilities on the face of balance sheet. Others are depicted as long-term provisions under non-current liabilities on the face of balance sheet. 2024-25 156 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements Fixed assets There is no change in the treatment of fixed assets. Both tangible and intangible assets are non-current. This may also be noted if the useful life of the asset is less than 12 months, it will still fall under non-current. Investments Investments are also classified into current and non-current categories. Investments expected to realise within twelve months are considered as current investments under current assets. Others are classified as non-current investments under non-current assets. Both are however shown on the face of the balance sheet. Inventories All inventories are always treated as current. Trade receivables Trade receivables realised beyond twelve months from reporting date/ operating cycle starting from the date of their recognition are classified as “Other non-current assets” under the head non-current assets with Note to Accounts. For example, sale of goods or services rendered in normal course of business. Others are classified as current assets and shown on the face of the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalent It is always current however, amounts which qualify as cash and cash equivalents as per AS-3 is shown here.
