Accounting Ratios 5 Financial statements aim at providing financial information about a business enterprise to meet the information needs of the decision-makers. Financial statements prepared by a business enterprise in the corporate sector are published and are available to the decision-makers. These statements provide financial data which require analysis, comparison and interpretation for taking decision by the external as well as internal users of accounting information. This act is termed as financial statement analysis. It is regarded as  an integral and important part of accounting. As indicated in the previous chapter, the most commonly used techniques of financial statements analysis are comparative statements, common size LEARNING OBJECTIVES statements, trend analysis, accounting ratios and After studying this chapter, you will be able to : cash flow analysis. The first three have been • explain the meaning, discussed in detail in the previous chapter.

A ratio is a • interpret the various mathematical number calculated as a reference to ratios calculated for relationship of two or more numbers and can be intra-firm and inter- expressed as a fraction, proportion, percentage and firm comparisons. a number of times. When the number is calculated by referring to two accounting numbers derived from 2024-25 Accounting Ratios 195 the financial statements, it is termed as accounting ratio. For example, if the gross profit of the business is Rs. 10,000 and the ‘Revenue from Operations’ are 10, 000 Rs. 1,00,000, it can be said that the gross profit is 10% × 100  of the 1, 00, 000 ‘Revenue from Operations’. This ratio is termed as gross profit ratio. Similarly, inventory turnover ratio may be 6 which implies that inventory turns into ‘Revenue from Operations’ six times in a year. It needs to be observed that accounting ratios exhibit relationship, if any, between accounting numbers extracted from financial statements. Ratios are essentially derived numbers and their efficacy depends a great deal upon the basic numbers from which they are calculated. Hence, if the financial statements contain some errors, the derived numbers in terms of ratio analysis would also present an erroneous scenario. Further, a ratio must be calculated using numbers which are meaningfully correlated. A ratio calculated by using two unrelated numbers would hardly serve any purpose. For example, the furniture of the business is Rs. 1,00,000 and Purchases are Rs. 3,00,000. The ratio of purchases to furniture is 3 (3,00,000/1,00,000) but it hardly has any relevance. The reason is that there is no relationship between these two aspects. 5.2 Objectives of Ratio Analysis Ratio analysis is indispensable part of interpretation of results revealed by the financial statements. It provides users with crucial financial information and points out the areas which require investigation. Ratio analysis is a technique which involves regrouping of data by application of arithmetical relationships, though its interpretation is a complex matter. It requires a fine understanding of the way and the rules used for preparing financial statements. Once done effectively, it provides a lot of information which helps the analyst: 1. To know the areas of the business which need more attention; 2. To know about the potential areas which can be improved with the effort in the desired direction; 3. To provide a deeper analysis of the profitability, liquidity, solvency and efficiency levels in the business; 4. To provide information for making cross-sectional analysis by comparing the performance with the best industry standards; and 5. To provide information derived from financial statements useful for making projections and estimates for the future. 5.3 Advantages of Ratio Analysis The ratio analysis if properly done improves the user’s understanding of the efficiency with which the business is being conducted. The numerical 2024-25 196 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements relationships throw light on many latent aspects of the business. If properly analysed, the ratios make us understand various problem areas as well as the bright spots of the business. The knowledge of problem areas help management take care of them in future. The knowledge of areas which are working better helps you improve the situation further. It must be emphasised that ratios are means to an end rather than the end in themselves. Their role is essentially indicative and that of a whistle blower. There are many advantages derived from ratio analysis. These are summarised as follows: 1. Helps to understand efficacy of decisions: The ratio analysis helps you to understand whether the business firm has taken the right kind of operating, investing and financing decisions. It indicates how far they have helped in improving the performance. 2. Simplify complex figures and establish relationships: Ratios help in simplifying the complex accounting figures and bring out their relationships. They help summarise the financial information effectively and assess the managerial efficiency, firm’s credit worthiness, earning capacity, etc. 3. Helpful in comparative analysis: The ratios are not be calculated for one year only. When many year figures are kept side by side, they help a great deal in exploring the trends visible in the business. The knowledge of trend helps in making projections about the business which is a very useful feature. 4. Identification of problem areas: Ratios help business in identifying the problem areas as well as the bright areas of the business. Problem areas would need more attention and bright areas will need polishing to have still better results. 5. Enables SWOT analysis: Ratios help a great deal in explaining the changes occurring in the business. The information of change helps the management a great deal in understanding the current threats and opportunities and allows business to do its own SWOT (StrengthWeakness-Opportunity-Threat) analysis. 6. Various comparisons: Ratios help comparisons with certain bench marks to assess as to whether firm’s performance is better or otherwise. For this purpose, the profitability, liquidity, solvency, etc., of a business, may be compared: (i) over a number of accounting periods with itself (Intra-firm Comparison/Time Series Analysis), (ii) with other business enterprises (Inter-firm Comparison/Cross-sectional Analysis) and (iii) with standards set for that firm/industry (comparison with standard (or industry expectations). 2024-25 Accounting Ratios 197 5.4 Limitations of Ratio Analysis Since the ratios are derived from the financial statements, any weakness in the original financial statements will also creep in the derived analysis in the form of ratio analysis. Thus, the limitations of financial statements also form the limitations of the ratio analysis. Hence, to interpret the ratios, the user should be aware of the rules followed in the preparation of financial statements and also their nature and limitations. The limitations of ratio analysis which arise primarily from the nature of financial statements are as under: 1. Limitations of Accounting Data: Accounting data give an unwarranted impression of precision and finality. In fact, accounting data “reflect a combination of recorded facts, accounting conventions and personal judgements which affect them materially. For example, profit of the business is not a precise and final figure. It is merely an opinion of the accountant based on application of accounting policies. The soundness of the judgement necessarily depends on the competence and integrity of those who make them and on their adherence to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Conventions”. Thus, the financial statements may not reveal the true state of affairs of the enterprises and so the ratios will also not give the true picture. 2. Ignores Price-level Changes: The financial accounting is based on stable money measurement principle. It implicitly assumes that price level changes are either non-existent or minimal. But the truth is otherwise. We are normally living in inflationary economies where the power of money declines constantly. A change in the price-level makes analysis of financial statement of different accounting years meaningless because accounting records ignore changes in value of money. 3. Ignore Qualitative or Non-monetary Aspects: Accounting provides information about quantitative (or monetary) aspects of business. Hence, the ratios also reflect only the monetary aspects, ignoring completely the non-monetary (qualitative) factors. 4. Variations in Accounting Practices: There are differing accounting policies for valuation of inventory, calculation of depreciation, treatment of intangibles Assets definition of certain financial variables etc., available for various aspects of business transactions. These variations leave a big question mark on the cross-sectional analysis. As there are variations in accounting practices followed by different business enterprises, a valid comparison of their financial statements is not possible. 5. Forecasting: Forecasting of future trends based only on historical analysis is not feasible. Proper forecasting requires consideration of non-financial factors as well. 2024-25 198 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements Now let us talk about the limitations of the ratios. The various limitations are: 1. Means and not the End: Ratios are means to an end rather than the end by itself. 2. Lack of ability to resolve problems: Their role is essentially indicative and of whistle blowing and not providing a solution to the problem. 3. Lack of standardised definitions: There is a lack of standardised definitions of various concepts used in ratio analysis. For example, there is no standard definition of liquid liabilities. Normally, it includes all current liabilities, but sometimes it refers to current liabilities less bank overdraft. 4. Lack of universally accepted standard levels: There is no universal yardstick which specifies the level of ideal ratios. There is no standard list of the levels universally acceptable, and, in India, the industry averages are also not available. 5. Ratios based on unrelated figures: A ratio calculated for unrelated figures would essentially be a meaningless exercise. For example, creditors of Rs. 1,00,000 and furniture of Rs. 1,00,000 represent a ratio of 1:1. But it has no relevance to assess efficiency or solvency. Hence, ratios should be used with due consciousness of their limitations while evaluating the performance of an organisation and planning the future strategies for its improvement. Test your Understanding – I 1. State which of the following statements are True or False. (a) The only purpose of financial reporting is to keep the managers informed about the progress of operations. (b) Analysis of data provided in the financial statements is termed as financial analysis. (c) Long-term borrowings are concerned about the ability of a firm to discharge its obligations to pay interest and repay the principal amount. (d) A ratio is always expressed as a quotient of one number divided by another. (e) Ratios help in comparisons of a firm’s results over a number of accounting periods as well as with other business enterprises. (f) A ratio reflects quantitative and qualitative aspects of results. 5.5 Types of Ratios There is a two way classification of ratios: (1) traditional classification, and (2) functional classification. The traditional classification has been on the basis of financial statements to which the determinants of ratios belong. On this basis the ratios are classified as follows: 2024-25 Accounting Ratios 199 1. ‘Statement of Profit and Loss Ratios: A ratio of two variables from the statement of profit and loss is known as statement of profit and loss ratio. For example, ratio of gross profit to revenue from operations is known as gross profit ratio. It is calculated using both figures from the statement of profit and loss. 2. Balance Sheet Ratios: In case both variables are from the balance sheet, it is classified as balance sheet ratios. For example, ratio of current assets to current liabilities known as current ratio. It is calculated using both figures from balance sheet. 3. Composite Ratios: If a ratio is computed with one variable from the statement of profit and loss and another variable from the balance sheet, it is called composite ratio. For example, ratio of credit revenue from operations to trade receivables (known as trade receivables turnover ratio) is calculated using one figure from the statement of profit and loss (credit revenue from operations) and another figure (trade receivables) from the balance sheet. Although accounting ratios are calculated by taking data from financial statements but classification of ratios on the basis of financial statements is rarely used in practice. It must be recalled that basic purpose of accounting is to throw light on the financial performance (profitability) and financial position (its capacity to raise money and invest them wisely) as well as changes occurring in financial position (possible explanation of changes in the activity level). As such, the alternative classification (functional classification) based on the purpose for which a ratio is computed, is the most commonly used classification which is as follows: 1. Liquidity Ratios: To meet its commitments, business needs liquid funds. The ability of the business to pay the amount due to stakeholders as and when it is due is known as liquidity, and the ratios calculated to measure it are known as ‘Liquidity Ratios’. These are essentially short-term in nature. 2. Solvency Ratios: Solvency of business is determined by its ability to meet its contractual obligations towards stakeholders, particularly towards external stakeholders, and the ratios calculated to measure solvency position are known as ‘Solvency Ratios’. These are essentially long-term in nature. 3. Activity (or Turnover) Ratios:  This refers to the ratios that are calculated for measuring the efficiency of operations of business based on effective utilisation of resources. Hence, these are also known as ‘Efficiency Ratios’. 4. Profitability Ratios: It refers to the analysis of profits in relation to revenue from operations or funds (or assets) employed in the business and the ratios calculated to meet this objective are known as ‘Profitability Ratios’. 2024-25 200 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements 5.6 Liquidity Ratios Liquidity ratios are calculated to measure the short-term solvency of the business, i.e. the firm’s ability to meet its current obligations. These are analysed by looking at the amounts of current assets and current liabilities in the balance sheet. The two ratios included in this category are current ratio and liquidity ratio. 5.6.1  Current Ratio Current ratio is the proportion of current assets to current liabilities. It is expressed as follows: Current Assets Current Ratio  =  Current Assets : Current Liabilities or Current Liabilities Current assets include current investments, inventories, trade receivables (debtors and bills receivables), cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and advances and other current assets such as prepaid expenses, advance tax and accrued income, etc. Current liabilities include short-term borrowings, trade payables (creditors and bills payables), other current liabilities and short-term provisions. Illustration 1 Calulate Current Ratio from the following information: Particulars (Rs.) Inventories 50,000 Trade receivables 50,000 Advance tax 4,000 Cash and cash equivalents 30,000 Trade payables 1,00,000 Short-term borrowings (bank overdraft) 4,000 Solution: Current Assets Current Ratio = Current Liabilities Current Assets = Inventories + Trade receivables + Advance tax + Cash and cash equivalents = Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 4,000 + Rs. 30,000 = Rs. 1,34,000 Current Liabilities = Trade payables + Short-term borrowings = Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 4,000 = Rs. 1,04,000 Rs.1,34,000 Current Ratio = =1.29 :1 Rs.1,04,000 2024-25 Accounting Ratios 201 Significance: It provides a measure of degree to which current assets cover current liabilities. The excess of current assets over current liabilities provides a measure of safety margin available against uncertainty in realisation of current assets and flow of funds. The ratio should be reasonable. It should neither be very high or very low. Both the situations have their inherent disadvantages. A very high current ratio implies heavy investment in current assets which is not a good sign as it reflects under utilisation or improper utilisation of resources. A low ratio endangers the business and puts it at risk of facing a situation where it will not be able to pay its short-term debt on time. If this problem persists, it may affect firm’s credit worthiness adversely. Normally, it is safe to have this ratio within the range of 2:1. 5.6.2 Quick or Liquid Ratio It is the ratio of quick (or liquid) asset to current liabilities. It is expressed as Quick Assets Quick ratio = Quick Assets : Current Liabilities  or Current Liabilities The quick assets are defined as those assets which are quickly convertible into cash. While calculating quick assets we exclude the inventories at the end and other current assets such as prepaid expenses, advance tax, etc., from the current assets. Because of exclusion of non-liquid current assets it is considered better than current ratio as a measure of liquidity position of the business. It is calculated to serve as a supplementary check on liquidity position of the business and is therefore, also known as ‘Acid-Test Ratio’. Illustration 2 Calculate quick ratio from the information given in illustration 1. Solution: Quick Assets Quick Ratio = Current Liabilities Quick Assets = Current assets – (Inventories + Advance tax) = Rs. 1,34,000 – (Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 4,000) = Rs. 80,000 Current Liabilities = Rs. 1,04,000 Rs. 80,000 Quick Ratio = = 0.77 :1 Rs. 1,04,000 Significance: The ratio provides a measure of the capacity of the business to meet its short-term obligations without any flaw. Normally, it is advocated to be 2024-25 202 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements safe to have a ratio of 1:1 as unnecessarily low ratio will be very risky and a high ratio suggests unnecessarily deployment of resources in otherwise less profitable short-term investments. Illustration 3 Calculate ‘Liquid Ratio’ from the following information: Current liabilities = Rs. 50,000 Current assets = Rs. 80,000 Inventories = Rs. 20,000 Advance tax = Rs.   5,000 Prepaid expenses = Rs.   5,000 Solution Liquid Assets Liquid Ratio = Current Liabilities Liquid Assets = Current assets – (Inventories + Prepaid expenses + Advance tax) = Rs. 80,000 – (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 5,000 + Rs. 5,000) = Rs. 50,000 Rs. 50,000 Liquid Ratio = = 1 :1 Rs. 50,000 Illustration 4 X Ltd., has a current ratio of 3.5:1 and quick ratio of 2:1. If excess of current assets over quick assets represented by inventories is Rs. 24,000, calculate current assets and current liabilities. Solution: Current Ratio = 3.5:1 Quick Ratio = 2:1 Let Current liabilities = x Current assets = 3.5x and Quick assets = 2x Inventories = Current assets – Quick assets 24,000 = 3.5x – 2x 24,000 = 1.5x x = Rs.16,000 Current Liabilities = Rs.16,000 Current Assets = 3.5x  =  3.5 × Rs. 16,000  =  Rs. 56,000. 2024-25 Accounting Ratios 203 Verification : Current Ratio = Current assets : Current liabilities = Rs. 56,000 : Rs. 16,000 = 3.5 : 1 Quick Ratio = Quick assets : Current liabilities = Rs. 32,000 : Rs. 16,000 = 2 : 1 Illustration 5 Calculate the current ratio from the following information: Total assets = Rs. 3,00,000 Non-current liabilities = Rs.    80,000 Shareholders’ Funds = Rs. 2,00,000 Non-Current Assets: Fixed assets = Rs. 1,60,000 Non-current Investments = Rs. 1,00,000 Solution: Total assets = Non-current assets + Current assets Rs. 3,00,000 = Rs. 2,60,000 + Current assets Current assets = Rs. 3,00,000 – Rs. 2,60,000   =  Rs. 40,000 Total assets = Equity and Liabilities = Shareholders’ Funds + Non-current liabilities + Current liabilities Rs. 3,00,000 = Rs. 2,00,000 + Rs. 80,000 + Current Liabilities Current liabilities = Rs. 3,00,000 – Rs. 2,80,000 =   Rs. 20,000 Current Assets Current Ratio = Current Liabilities Rs. 40,000 = = 2 :1 Rs. 20,000 Do it Yourself 1.

Calculate the value of current liabilities, liquid assets and inventories. 2024-25 204 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements Illustration 6 The current ratio is 2 : 1. State giving reasons which of the following transactions would improve, reduce and not change the current ratio: (a) Payment of current liability; (b) Purchased goods on credit; (c) Sale of a Computer (Book value: Rs. 4,000) for Rs. 3,000 only; (d) Sale of merchandise (goods) costing Rs. 10,000 for Rs. 11,000; (e) Payment of unclaimed dividend. Solution: The given current ratio is 2 : 1. Let us assume that current assets are Rs. 50,000 and current liabilities are Rs. 25,000; Thus, the current ratio is 2 : 1. Now we will analyse the effect of given transactions on current ratio. (a) Assume that Rs. 10,000 of creditors is paid by cheque. This will reduce the current assets to Rs. 40,000 and current liabilities to Rs. 15,000. The new ratio will be 2.67 : 1 (Rs. 40,000/Rs.15,000). Hence, it has improved. (b) Assume that goods of Rs. 10,000 are purchased on credit. This will increase the current assets to Rs. 60,000 and current liabilities to Rs. 35,000. The new ratio will be 1.7:1 (Rs. 60,000/Rs. 35,000). Hence, it has reduced. (c) Due to sale of a computer (a fixed asset) the current assets will increase to Rs. 53,000 without any change in the current liabilities. The new ratio will be 2.12 : 1 (Rs. 53,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has improved. (d) This transaction will decrease the inventories by Rs. 10,000 and increase the cash by Rs. 11,000 thereby increasing the current assets by Rs. 1,000 without any change in the current liabilities. The new ratio will be 2.04 : 1 (Rs. 51,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has improved. (e) Assume that `5,000 is given by way of unclaimed dividend. It will reduce the current assets to ̀ 45,000 and unclaimed current liabilities by `5,000. The new ratio will be 2:25:1 (`45,000/`20,000). Hence, it has improved. 5.7 Solvency Ratios The persons who have advanced money to the business on long-term basis are interested in safety of their periodic payment of interest  as well as the 2024-25 Accounting Ratios 205 repayment of principal amount at the end of the loan period. Solvency ratios are calculated to determine the ability of the business to service its debt in the long run. The following ratios are normally computed for evaluating solvency of the business. 1. Debt-Equity Ratio; 2. Debt to Capital Employed Ratio; 3. Proprietary Ratio; 4. Total Assets to Debt Ratio; 5. Interest Coverage Ratio. 5.7.1 Debt-Equity Ratio Debt-Equity Ratio measures the relationship between long-term debt and equity. If debt component of the total long-term funds employed is small, outsiders feel more secure. From security point of view, capital structure with less debt and more equity is considered favourable as it reduces the chances of bankruptcy.  Normally, it is considered to be safe if debt equity ratio is 2 : 1. However, it may vary from industry to industry. It is computed as follows: Long − term Debts Debt-Equity Ratio = Shareholders’ Funds where: Shareholders’ Funds (Equity) = Share capital + Reserves and Surplus + Money received against share warrants + Share application money pending allotment Share Capital = Equity share capital + Preference share capital or Shareholders’ Funds (Equity) = Non-current sssets + Working capital – Non-current liabilities Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities Significance: This ratio measures the degree of indebtedness of an enterprise and gives an idea to the long-term lender regarding extent of security of the debt. As indicated earlier, a low debt equity ratio reflects more security. A high ratio, on the other hand, is considered risky as it may put the firm into difficulty in meeting its obligations to outsiders. However, from the perspective of the owners, greater use of debt (trading on equity) may help in ensuring higher returns for them if the rate of earnings on capital employed is higher than the rate of interest payable. 2024-25 206 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements Illustration 7 From the following balance sheet of ABC Co.

Tangible Assets: Plant and Machinery 5,00,000 Land and Building 4,00,000 Motor Car 1,50,000 Furniture 50,000 11,00,000 Solution: Long - term Debts Debt-Equity Ratio = Equity (Shareholders’ Funds) Long-term Debts = Long-term Borrowings = Rs. 1,50,000 Equity = Share capital + Reserves and surplus+ Share application money pending allotment = Rs. 8,00,000 + Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 2,00,000 = Rs. 11,00,000 1,50,000 Debt Equity Ratio =  = 0.136 : 1 11,00,000 5.7.2 Debt to Capital Employed Ratio The Debt to capital employed ratio refers to the ratio of long-term debt to the total of external and internal funds (capital employed or net assets). It is computed as follows: Debt to Capital Employed Ratio = Long-term Debt/Capital Employed (or Net Assets) Capital employed is equal to the long-term debt + shareholders’ funds. Alternatively, it may be taken as net assets which are equal to the total assets – current liabilities taking the data of Illustration 7, capital employed shall work out to Rs. 5,00,000 + Rs. 15,00,000 = Rs. 20,00,000. Similarly, Net Assets as Rs. 25,00,000 – Rs. 5,00,000 = Rs. 20,00,000 and the Debt to capital employed ratio as Rs. 5,00,000/Rs. 20,00,000 = 0.25:1. Significance: Like debt-equity ratio, it shows proportion of long-term debts in capital employed. Low ratio provides security to lenders and high ratio helps management in trading on equity. In the above case, the debt to Capital Employed ratio is less than half which indicates reasonable funding by debt and adequate security of debt. It may be noted that Debt  to Capital Employed Ratio can also be computed in relation to total assets. In that case, it usually refers to the ratio of total 2024-25 Accounting Ratios 209 debts (long-term debts + current liabilities) to total assets, i.e., total of noncurrent and current assets (or shareholders’, funds + long-term debts + current liabilities), and is expressed as Total Debts Debt to Capital Employed Ratio = Total Assets 5.7.3    Proprietary Ratio Proprietary ratio expresses relationship of proprietor’s (shareholders) funds to net assets and is calculated as follows : Proprietary Ratio =  Shareholders’, Funds/Capital employed (or net assets) Based on data of Illustration 7, it shall be worked out as follows: Rs. 15,00,000/Rs. 20,00,000 = 0.75 : 1 Significance: Higher proportion of shareholders funds in financing the assets is a positive feature as it provides security to creditors. This ratio can also be computed in relation to total assets instead of net assets (capital employed). It may be noted that the total of debt to capital employed ratio and proprietory ratio is equal to 1. Take these ratios worked out on the basis of data of Illustration 7, the debt  to Capital Employed  ratio is 0.25 : 1 and the Proprietory Ratio 0.75 : 1 the total is 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. In terms of percentage it can be stated that the 25% of the capital employed is funded by debts and 75% by owners’ funds. 5.7.4 Total Assets to Debt Ratio This ratio measures the extent of the coverage of long-term debts by assets. It is calculated as Total assets to Debt Ratio  =  Total assets/Long-term debts Taking the data of Illustration 8, this ratio will be worked out as follows: Rs. 14,00,000/Rs. 1,50,000 = 9.33 : 1 The higher ratio indicates that assets have been mainly financed by owners funds and the long-term loans is adequately covered by assets.
