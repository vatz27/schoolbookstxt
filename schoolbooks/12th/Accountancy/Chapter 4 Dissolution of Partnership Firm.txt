Dissolution of Partnership Firm 4 You have learnt about the reconstitution of a partnership firm which takes place on account of admission, retirement or death of a partner. In such a situation while the existing partnership is dissolved, the firm may continue under the same name if the partners so decide. In other words, it results in the dissolution of a partnership but not that of the firm. LEARNING OBJECTIVES According to Section 39 of the partnership Act 1932, After studying this chapter the dissolution of partnership between all the partners you will be able to : of a firm is called the dissolution of the firm. That • State the meaning of means the Act recognises the difference in the dissolution of breaking of relationship between all the partners of a partnership firm; firm and between some of the partners; and it is the • Differentiate between dissolution of partner- breaking or discontinuance of relationship between ship and dissolution of all the partners which is termed as the dissolution of a partnership firm; partnership firm. This brings an end to the existence • Describe the various of firm, and no business is transacted after modes of dissolution of dissolution except the activities related to closing of the partnership firm; the firm as the affairs of the firm are to be wound up • Explain the rules by selling firm’s assets and paying its liabilities and relating to the discharging the claims of the partners. settlement of claims among all partners; 4.1  Dissolution of Partnership • Prepare Realisation Account; As stated earlier dissolution of partnership changes the existing relationship between partners but the firm may continue its business as before. The dissolution of partnership may take place in any of the following ways: (1) Change in existing profit sharing ratio among partners; (2) Admission of a new partner; 2024-25 Dissolution of Partnership Firm 157 (3) Retirement of a partner; (4) Death of a partner; (5) Insolvency of a partner; (6) Completion of the venture, if partnership is formed for that; and (7) Expiry of the period of partnership, if partnership is for a specific period of time; 4.2  Dissolution of a Firm Dissolution of a partnership firm may take place without the intervention of court or by the order of a court, in any of the ways specified later in this section. It may be noted that dissolution of the firm necessarily brings in dissolution of the partnership. However, dissolution of partnership would not necessarily involve dissolution of firms. Dissolution of a firm takes place in any of the following ways: 1. Dissolution by Agreement: A firm is dissolved : (a) with the consent of all the partners or (b) in accordance with a contract between the partners. 2. Compulsory Dissolution: A firm is dissolved compulsorily in the following cases: (a) when all the partners or all but one partner, become insolvent, rendering them incompetent to sign a contract; (b) when the business of the firm becomes illegal; or (c) when some event has taken place which makes it unlawful for the partners to carry on the business of the firm in partnership, e.g., when a partner who is a citizen of a country becomes an alien enemy because of the declaration of war with his country and India. 3. On the happening of certain contingencies: Subject to contract between the partners, a firm is dissolved : (a) if constituted for a fixed term, by the expiry of that term; (b) if constituted to carry out one or more ventures, by the completion thereof; (c) by the death of a partner; (d) by the adjudication of a partner as an insolvent. 4. Dissolution by Notice: In case of partnership at will, the firm may be dissolved if any one of the partners gives a notice in writing to the other partners, signifying his intention of seeking dissolution of the firm. 5. Dissolution by Court: At the suit of a partner, the court may order a partnership firm to be dissolved on any of the following grounds: (a) when a partner becomes insane; (b) when a partner becomes permanently incapable of performing his duties as a partner; 2024-25 158 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts (c) when a partner is guilty of misconduct which is likely to adversely affect the business of the firm; (d) when a partner persistently commits breach of partnership agreement; (e) when a partner has transferred the whole of his interest in the firm to a third party; (f) when the business of the firm cannot be carried on except at a loss; or (g) when, on any ground, the court regards dissolution to be just and equitable.

Test your Understanding – I State giving reasons, which of the following statements are true or false: 1. Dissolution of a partnership is different from dissolution of a firm, 2. A partnership is dissolved when there is a death of a partner, 3. A firm is dissolved when all partners give consent to it. 4. A firm is compulsorily dissolved when a partner decide to retire. 5. Dissolution of a firm necessarily involves dissolution of partnership. 6. A firm is compulsorily dissolved when all partners or when all except one partner become involvent. 7. Court can order a firm to be dissolved when a partner becomes insane. 8. Dissolution of partnership can not take place without intervention of the court. 2024-25 Dissolution of Partnership Firm 159 4.3 Settlement of Accounts In case of dissolution of a firm, the firm ceases to conduct business and has to settle its accounts. For this purpose, it disposes off all its assets for satisfying all the claims against it. In this context it should be noted that, subject to agreement among the partners, the following rules as provided in Section 48 of the Partnership Act 1932 shall apply. (a) Treatment of Losses Losses, including deficiencies of capital, shall be paid : (i) first out of profits, (ii) next out of capital of partners, and (iii) lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in their profit sharing ratio. (b) Application of Assets The assets of the firm, including any sum contributed by the partners to make up deficiencies of capital, shall be applied in the following manner and order: (i) In paying the debts of the firm to the third parties; (ii) In paying each partner proportionately what is due to him/her from the firm for advances as distinguished from capital (i.e. partner’ loan); (iii) In paying to each partner proportionately what is due to him on account of capital; and (iv) the residue, if any, shall be divided among the partners in their profit sharing ratio. Thus, the amount realised from assets along with contribution from partners, if required, shall be utilised first to pay off the outside liabilities of the firm such as creditors, loans, bank overdraft, bill payables, etc. (it may be noted that secured loans have precedence over the unsecured loans); the balance should be applied to repay loans made by the partners to the firm. (in case the balance amount is not adequate enough to pay off such loans and advances, they are to be paid propartionately). The amount left thereafter is utilised in settlement of capital account balances. Then the surplus if any is divided among partners in their profit sharing ratio. Private Debts and Firm’s Debts: Where both the debts of the firm and private debts of a partner co-exist, the following rules, as stated in Section 49 of the Act, shall apply. (a) The property of the firm shall be applied first in the payment of debts of the firm and then the surplus, if any, shall be divided among the partners as per their claims, which can be utilised for payment of their private liabilities. (b) The private property of any partner shall be applied first in payment of his private debts and the surplus, if any, may be utilised for payment of the firm’s debts, in case the firm’s liabilities exceed the firm’s assets. It may be noted that the private property of the partner does not include the personal properties of his wife and children. Thus, if the assets of the firm are not adequate enough to pay off firm’s liabilities, the partners have to contribute out of their net private assets (private assets minus private liabilities). 2024-25 160 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts Inability of a Partner to Contribute Towards Deficiency In the context of settlement of accounts among the partners there is still another important aspect to be noted, i.e., when a partner is unable to contribute towards the deficiency of his capital account (the account finally showing a debit balance), he/she is said to be insolvent, and the sum not recoverable is treated as capital loss for the firm. In the absence of any agreement, to the contrary, such a capital loss is to be borne by the remaining solvent partners in accordance with the principle laid down in Garner vs. Murray case, which states that the solvent partners have to bear such loss in the ratio of their capitals as on the date of dissolution. However, the accounting treatment relating to dissolution of partnership on account of insolvency of partners is not being taken up at this stage. 4.4 Accounting Treatment When the firm is dissolved, its books of account are to be closed and the profit or loss arising on realisation of its assets and discharge of liabilities is to be computed. For this purpose, a Realisation Account is prepared to ascertain the net effect (profit or loss) of realisation of assets and payment of liabilities which may be is transferred to partner’s capital accounts in their profit sharing ratio. Hence, all assets (other than cash in hand bank balance and fictitious assets, if any), and all external liabilities are transferred to this account. It also records the sale of assets, and payment of liabilities and realisation expenses. The balance in this account is termed as profit or loss on realisation which is transferred to partners’ capital accounts in the profit sharing ratio (see figure 4.1). Dr.   Realisation Account Cr.
