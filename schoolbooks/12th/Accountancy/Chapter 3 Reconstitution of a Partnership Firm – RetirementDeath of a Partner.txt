(ii) credit balance of his current account (if any); (iii) his share of goodwill; (iv) his share of accumulated profits (reserves); (v) his share in the gain of revaluation of assets and liabilities; 2024-25 108 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts (vi) his share of profits up to the date of retirement/death; (vii) interest on his capital, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death; and (viii) salary/commission, if any, due to him up to the date of retirement/death. The following deductions, if any, may have to be made from his share: (i) debit balance of his current account (if any); (ii) his share of goodwill to be written off, if necessary; (iii) his share of accumulated losses; (iv) his share of loss on revaluation of assets and liabilities; (v) his share of loss up to the date of retirement/death; (vi) his drawings up to the date of  retirement/death; (vii) interest on drawings, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death. Thus, similar to admission, the various accounting aspects involved on retirement or death of a partner are as follows: 1. Ascertainment of new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio; 2. Treatment of goodwill; 3. Revaluation of assets and  liabilities; 4. Adjustment in respect of unrecorded assets and liabilities; 5. Distribution of accumulated profits and losses; 6. Ascertainment of share of profit or loss up to the date of retirement/death; 7. Adjustment of capital, if required; 8. Settlement of the amounts due to retired/deceased partner; 3.2 New Profit Sharing Ratio New profit sharing ratio is the ratio in which the remaining partners will share future profits after the retirement or death of any partner. The new share of each of the remaining partner will consist of his own share in the firm plus the share acquired from the retiring /deceased partner. Consider the following situations : (a) normally, the continuing partners acquire the share of retiring or deceased partners in the old profit sharing ratio, and there is no need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them, as it will be same as the old profit sharing ratio among them. In fact, in the absence of any information regarding profit sharing ratio in which the remaining partners acquire the share of retiring/deceased partner, it is assumed that they will acquire it in the old profit sharing ratio and so share the future profits in their old ratio. For example, Asha, Deepti and Nisha are partners in a firm sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2:1. If Deepti retires, the new profit sharing ratio between Asha and Nisha will be 3:1, unless they decide otherwise. (b) The continuing partners may acquire the share in the profits of the retiring/deceased partner in a proportion other than their old ratio, In that case, there is need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them. For example: Naveen, Suresh and Tarun are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5:3:2. Suresh retires from the firm and his share was 2024-25 Retirement/Death of a Partner 109 required by Naveen and Tarun in the ratio 2:1. In such a case, the new share of profit will be calculated as follows: New share of Continuing Partner = Old Share + Acquired share from the Outgoing Partner Gaining Ratio 2 : 1 2 3 Share acquired by Naveen =  of 3 10 2 3 2 =     = 3 10 10 1 3 Share acquired by Tarun = of 3 10 1 3 1 =      = 3 10 10 5 2 7 Share of Naveen =  +  = 10 10 10 2 1 3 Share of Tarun = + = 10 10 10 Thus, the new profit sharing ratio of Naveen and Tarun will be = 7 : 3. (c) The contributing partners may agree on a specified new profit sharing ratio: In that case the ratio so specified will be the new profit sharing ratio. 3.3 Gaining Ratio The ratio in which the continuing partners have acquired the share from the retiring/deceased partner is called the gaining ratio. Normally, the continuing partners acquire the share of retiring/deceased partner in their old profit sharing ratio, In that case, the gaining ratio of the remaining partners will be the same as their old profit sharing ratio among them and there is no need to compute the gaining ratio, Alternatively, proportion in which they acquire the share of the retiring/deceased partner may be duly spacified. In that case, again, there is no need to calculate the gaining ratio as it will be the ratio in which they have acquired the share of profit from the retiring deceased partner. The problem of calculating gaining ratio arises primarily when the new profit sharing ratio of the continuing partners is specified. In such a situation, the gaining ratio should be calculated by, deducting the old share of each continuing partners from his new share i.e., new profit share minus old profit share, i.e., new profit share minus old profit share. For example, Amit, Dinesh and Gagan are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3:2. Dinesh retires. Amit and Gagan decide to share the profits of the new firm in the ratio of  3:2. The gaining ratio will be calculated as follows : 2024-25 110 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts 3 5 6  5 1 Amit’s Gaining Share =     5 10 10 10 2 2 4  2 2 Gagan’s Gaining Share =     5 10 10 10 Thus, Gaining Ratio of Amit and Gagan = 1:2 1 2 This implies Amit gains  and Gagan gains  of Dinesh’s share of profit. 3 3 Gaining share of Continuing Partner = New share – Old share Do it Yourself Distinguish between Gaining Ratio and Sacrificing Ratio in terms of: 1.

Calculate new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio if 1. Madhu retires 2. Neha retires 3. Tina retires. Solution Given old ratio among   Madhu :  Neha : Tina as 5 : 3 : 2 1. If  Madhu retires, new profit sharing Ratio between Neha and Tina will be Neha : Tina = 3:2 and Gaining Ratio of Neha and Tina =3:2 2. If  Neha retires new profit sharing Ratio between Madhu and Tina will be Madhu : Tina = 5:2 Gaining Ratio of Madhu and Tina = 5:2 3. If  Tina retires, new profit sharing ratio between Madhu and Neha will be: Madhu : Neha = 5:3 Gaining ratio of Madhu and Neha = 5:3 Illustration 2 Alka, Harpreet and Shreya are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1. Alka retires and her share is taken up by Harpreet and Shreya in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio. 2024-25 Retirement/Death of a Partner 111 Solution 3 2 Gaining Given, Ratio of Harpreet and Shreya = 3:2 = : 5 5 3 2 1 Old Profit Sharing Ratio of between Alka, Harpreet and Shreya 3:2:1 = : : 6 6 6 3 3 9 Share acquired by Harpreet =  of  = 5 6 30 2 3 6 Share acquired by Shreya =  of  = 5 6 30 New Share =  Old Share + Acquired Share 2 9 19 Harpreet’s New Share =    6 30 30 1 6 11 Shreya’s  New Share =    6 30 30 New Profit Sharing Ratio of Harpreet and Shreya  =  19:11 Illustration 3 Murli, Naveen and Omprakash are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3 1 1 , and . Murli retires and surrenders 2/3rd of his share in favour of Naveen 8 2 8 and the remaining share in favour of Omprakash. Calculate new profit sharing and the gaining ratio of the remaining partners. Solution Naveen Omprakash 1 1 (i) Old Share 2 8 (ii) Share Acquired by Naveen and 2 3 2 1 3 1 Omprakash from Murli = of  of  3 8 8 3 8 8 1 2 1 1 (iii) New Share  = (i) + (ii) =   2 8 8 8 6 3 2 1 =  or =  or 8 4 8 4 3 1 Thus, the New profit sharing Ratio = :  or 3:1, and the 4 4 2024-25 112 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts 2 1 Gaining Ratio = :  or 2:1 [as calculated in (ii)]. 8 8 Illustration 4 Kumar, Lakshya, Manoj and Naresh are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3 : 2 : 1 : 4. Kumar retires and his share is acquired by Lakshya and Manoj in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio of the remaining partners. Solution Lakshya Manoj Naresh 2 1 4 (i) Old Share 10 10 10 3 3 2 3 (ii) Acquired Share from Kumar of of     Nil 5 10 5 10 9 6 = =     Nil 50 50 2 9 1 6 4 (iii) New share = (i) = (ii)  =  =  Nil 10 50 10 50 10 19 11 20 =  =  = 50 50 50 The New Profit Sharing Ratio is 19 : 11 : 20 Gaining ratio is 3 : 2 : 0 Notes : 1. Since Lakshya and Manoj are acquiring Kumar’s share of profit in the ratio of 3:2, hence, the gaining ratio will be 3:2 between Lakshya and Manoj. 2. Naresh has neither sacrificed nor gained. Illustration 5 Ranjana, Sadhna and Kamana are partners sharing profits in the ratio 4:3:2. Ranjana retires; Sadhna and Kamana decided to share profits in future in the ratio of 5:3.

Ashok and Ajay decide 2 10 5 to share future profits and losses in the ratio of 3 : 2. Calculate the gaining ratio. 3.4  Treatment of Goodwill The retiring or deceased partner is entitled to his share of goodwill at the time of retirement/death because the goodwill has been earned by the firm with the efforts of all the existing partners. Hence, at the time of retirement/death of a partner, goodwill is valued as per agreement among the partners the retiring/ deceased partner compensated for his share of goodwill by the continuing partners (who have gained due to acquisition of share of profit from the retiring/ deceased partner) in their gaining ratio. The accounting treatment for goodwill in such a situation depends upon whether or, not goodwill already appears in the books of the firm. 3.4.1 When goodwill does not appear in the books When goodwill does not appear in the books of the firm, credit is given to the retiring partner for the share in goodwill by debiting the goodwill account to gaining partners capital accounts (individually) in their gaining ratio. The journal entry is : 2024-25 114 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts Gaining Partners Capital A/c                   Dr.    (Individually) To Retiring Partners Capital A/c (Share in goodwill of retiring partner adjusted) Let us take an example to understand the treatment of goodwill. A, B and C are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1 B retired and the value of goodwill of the firm in valued at Rs. 60,000. A and C continue the business sharing profits in the ratio of 3:1.

In such a situation his capital account will also be credited along with the retiring/deceased partner’s capital account in proportion to his sacrifice and the other continuing partners’ capital accounts will be debited based on their gain in the future profit ratio.

Similarly, there may be certain liabilities which have been shown at a value different from the obligation to be met by the firm. Not only that, there may be some unrecorded assets and liabilities which need to be brought into books. As learnt in case of admission of a partner, a Revaluation Account is prepared in order to ascertain net gain (loss) on revaluation of assets and/or liabilities and bringing unrecorded items into firm’s books and the same is transferred to the capital account of all partners including retiring/deceased partners in their old profit sharing ratio. the Journal entries to be passed for this purpose are as follows: 1.
