Traditionally, the Government issued bonds, but these days, bonds are also being issued by semi-government and non-governmental organisations. The terms ‘debentures’ and ‘Bonds’ are now being used inter-changeably. 2.2 Distinction between Shares and Debentures Ownership: A ‘share’ represents ownership of the company whereas a debenture is only acknowledgement of Debt. A share is a part of the owned capital whereas a debenture is a part of borrowed capital. Return: The return on shares is known as dividend while the return on debentures is called interest. The rate of return on shares may vary from year to year depending upon the profits of the company but the rate of interest on debentures is prefixed. The payment of dividend is an appropriation of profits, whereas the payment of interest is a charge on profits and is to be paid even if there is no profit. Repayment:  Normally, the amount of shares is not returned during the life of the company, whereas, generally, the debentures are issued for a specified period and repayable on the expiry of that period. Voting Rights:  Shareholders enjoy voting rights whereas debentureholders do not normally enjoy any voting right. Security :  Shares are not secured by any charge whereas the debentures are generally secured and carry a fixed or floating charge over the assets of the company. Convertibility:  Shares cannot be converted into debentures whereas debentures can be converted into shares if the terms of issue so provide, and in that case these are known as convertible debentures. 2.3 Types of Debentures A company may issue different kinds of debentures which can be classified as under: 2.3.1 From the Point of view of Security (a) Secured Debentures: Secured debentures refer to those debentures where a charge is created on the assets of the company for the purpose of payment in case of default. The charge may be fixed or floating.  A fixed charge is created on a specific asset whereas a floating charge is 2024-25 Issue and Redemption of Debentures 77 on the general assets of the company. The fixed charge is created against those assets which are held by a company for use in operations not meant for sale whereas floating charge involves all assets excluding those assigned to the secured creditors. (b) Unsecured Debentures: Unsecured debentures do not have a specific charge on the assets of the company. However, a floating charge may be created on these debentures by default. Normally, these kinds of debentures are not issued. 2.3.2 From the Point of view of Tenure (a) Redeemable Debentures: Redeemable debentures are those which are payable on the expiry of the specific period either in lump sum or in Instalments during the life time of the company. Debentures can be redeemed either at par or at premium. (b) Irredeemable Debentures: Irredeemable debentures are also known as Perpetual Debentures because the company does not give any undertaking for the repayment of money borrowed by issuing such debentures.  These debentures are repayable on the winding-up of a company or on the expiry of a long period. 2.3.3 From the Point of view of Convertibility (a) Convertible Debentures: Debentures which are convertible into equity shares or in any other security either at the option of the company or the debentureholders are called convertible debentures. These debentures are either fully convertible or partly convertible. (b) Non-Convertible Debentures: The debentures which cannot be converted into shares or in any other securities are called nonconvertible debentures. Most debentures issued by companies fall in this category. 2.3.4 From Coupon Rate Point of view (a) Specific Coupon Rate Debentures: These debentures are issued with a specified rate of interest, which is called the coupon rate. The specified rate may either be fixed or floating. The floating interest rate is usually tagged with the bank rate. (b) Zero Coupon Rate Debentures: These debentures do not carry a specific rate of interest. In order to compensate the investors, such debentures are issued at substantial discount and the difference between the nominal value and the issue price is treated as the amount of interest related to the duration of the debentures. 2024-25 78 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements 2.3.5 From the view Point of Registration (a) Registered Debentures: Registered debentures are those debentures in respect of which all details including names, addresses and particulars of holding of the debentureholders are entered in a register kept by the company. Such debentures can be transferred only by executing a regular transfer deed. (b) Bearer Debentures: Bearer debentures are the debentures which can be transferred by way of delivery and the company does not keep any record of the debentures Interest on debentures is paid to a person who produces the interest coupon attached to such debentures.

The intending investors apply for debentures on the basis of the prospectus issued by the company. The company may either ask for the entire amount to be paid on application or by means of instalments on application, on allotment and on various calls. Debentures can be issued at par, at a premium or at a discount. They can also be issued for consideration other than cash or as a collateral security. 2024-25 Issue and Redemption of Debentures 79 2.4.1 Issue of Debentures for Cash Debentures are said to be issued at par when their issue price is equal to the face value.

For example, the issue of Rs. 100 debentures at Rs. 95, Rs. 5 being the amount of discount. The discount on issue of debentures can be written off either by debiting it to or out of Securities Premium Reserve, if any, during the life time of debentures.
