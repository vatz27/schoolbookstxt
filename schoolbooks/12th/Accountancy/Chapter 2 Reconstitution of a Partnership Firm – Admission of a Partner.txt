For example, Hari and existing partners. Haqque are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 2024-25 Admission of a Partner 49 3:2.  On April 1, 2017 they admitted John as a new partner with 1/6 share in profits of the firm. With this change now there are three partners of the firm and it stands reconstituted. Change in the profit sharing ratio among the existing partners: Sometimes the partners of a firm may decide to change their existing profit sharing ratio. This may happen an account of a change in the existing partners’ role in the firm. For example, Ram, Mohan and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1. With effect from April 1,2017 they decided to share profits equally as Sohan brings in additional capital. This results in a  change in the existing agreement leading to reconstitution of the firm. Retirement of an existing partner: It means withdrawal by a partner from the business of the firm which may be due to his bad health, old age or change in business interests. In fact a partner can retire any time if the partnership is at will. For example, Roy, Ravi and Rao are partners in the firm sharing profits in the ratio of 2:2:1.  On account of illness, Ravi retired from the firm on March 31, 2017.  This results in reconstitution of the firm now having only two partners. Death of a partner: Partnership may also stand reconstituted on death of a partner, if the remaining partners decide to continue the business of the firm as usual. For example, X,Y and Z are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio 3:2:1. X died on March 31, 2017. Y and Z decide to carry on the business sharing future profits equally. The continuity of business by Y and Z sharing future profits equally leads to reconstitution of the firm. 2.2 Admission of a New Partner When firm requires additional capital or managerial help or both for the expansion of its business a new partner may be admitted to supplement its existing resources.  According to the Partnership Act 1932, a new partner can be admitted into the firm only with the consent of all the existing partners unless otherwise agreed upon. With the admission of a new partner, the partnership firm is reconstituted and a new agreement is entered into to carry on the business of the firm. A newly admitted partner acquires two main rights in the firm– 1. Right to share the assets of the partnership firm; and 2. Right to share the profits of the partnership firm. For the right to acquire share in the assets and profits of the partnership firm, the partner brings an agreed amount of capital either in cash or in kind. Moreover, in the case of an established firm which may be earning more profits than the normal rate of return on its capital the new partner is required to contribute some additional amount known as premium or goodwill. This is done 2024-25 50 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts primarily to compensate the sacrificing partners for loss of their share in super profits of the firm. Following are the other important points which require attention at the time of admission of a new partner: 1. New profit sharing ratio; 2. Sacrificing ratio; 3. Valuation and adjustment of goodwill; 4. Revaluation of assets and Reassessment of liabilities; 5. Distribution of accumulated profits (reserves); and 6. Adjustment of partners’ capitals. 2.3 New Profit Sharing Ratio When new partner is admitted he acquires his share in profits from the old partners. In other words, on the admission of a new partner, the old partners sacrifice a share of their profit in favour of the new partner.  But, what will be the share of new partner and how he will acquire it from the existing partners is decided mutually among the old partners and the new partner. However, if nothing is specified as to how does the new partner acquire his share from the old partners; it may be assumed that he gets it from them in their profit sharing ratio. In any case, on admission of a new partner, the profit sharing ratio among the old partners will change keeping in view their respective contribution to the profit sharing ratio of the incoming partner.  Hence, there is a need to ascertain the new profit sharing ratio among all the partners. This depends upon how does the new partner acquires his share from the old partners for which there are many possibilities. Let us understand it with the help of the following illustrations. Illustration 1 Anil and Vishal are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2.  They admitted Sumit as a new partner for 1/5 share in the future profits of the firm.  Calculate new profit sharing ratio of Anil, Vishal and Sumit. Solution 1 Sumit’s share = 5 1 4 Remaining share = 1 = 5 5 3 4 12 Anil’s new share =   of = 5 5 25 2 4 8 Vishal’s new share =   of = 5 5 25 New profit sharing ratio of Anil, Vishal and Sumit will be 12:8:5. Note: It has been assumed that the new partner acquired his share from old partners in old ratio. 2024-25 Admission of a Partner 51 Illustration 2 Akshay and Bharati are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admit Dinesh as a new partner for 1/5th share in the future profits of the firm which he gets equally from Akshay and Bharati. Calculate new profit sharing ratio of Akshay, Bharati and Dinesh. Solution 1 2 Dinesh’s share =  or 5 10 3 1 5 Akshay’s share =   5 10 10 2 1 3 Bharati’s share =   5 10 10 New profit sharing ratio between Akshay, Bharati and Dinesh will be 5:3:2. Illustration 3 Anshu and Nitu are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admitted Jyoti as a new partner for 3/10 share which she acquired 2/10 from Anshu and 1/10 from Nitu.  Calculate the new profit sharing ratio of Anshu, Nitu and Jyoti. Solution 3 Jyoti’s share = 10 3 2 4 Anshu’s new share =   5 10 10 Nitu’s new share = Old share – Share Surrendered 2 1 3 =   5 10 10 The new profit sharing ratio between Anshu, Nitu and Jyoti will be  4 : 3 : 3. Illustration 4 Ram and Shyam are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admit Ghanshyam as a new partner. Ram sacrificed 1/4 of his share and Shyam 1/3 of his share in favour of Ghanshyam. Calculate new profit sharing ratio of Ram, Shyam and Ghanshyam. 2024-25 52 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts Solution 3 Ram’s old share = 5 1 3 3 Share sacrificed by Ram =  of   4 5 20 3 3 9 Ram’s new share =   5 20 20 2 Shyam’s old share = 5 1 2 2 Share sacrificed by Shyam = of   3 5 15 2 2 4 Shyam’s new share =   5 15 15 Ghanshyam’s new share = Ram’s sacrifice + Shyam’s Sacrifice 3 2 17 =   20 15 60 New profit sharing ratio among Ram, Shyam and Ghanshyam will be 27:16:17. Illustration 5 Das and Sinha are partners in a firm sharing profits in 4:1 ratio. They admitted Pal as a new partner for 1/4 share in the profits, which he acquired wholly from Das. Determine the new profit sharing ratio of the partners. Solution 1 Pal’s share = 4 Das’s new share = Old Share – Share Surrendered 4 1 11 =  = 5 4 20 1 Sinha’s new share = 5 The new profit sharing ratio among Das, Sinha and Pal will be 11:4:5. 2.4 Sacrificing Ratio The ratio in which the old partners agree to sacrifice their share of profit in favour of the incoming partner is called sacrificing ratio.  The sacrifice by a partner is equal to : Old Share of Profit – New Share of Profit 2024-25 Admission of a Partner 53 As stated earlier, the new partner is required to compensate the old partner’s for their loss of share in the super profits of the firm for which he brings in an additional amount as premium for goodwill. This amount is shared by the existing partners in the ratio in which they forgo their shares in favour of the new partner which is called sacrificing ratio. The ratio is normally clearly given as agreed among the partners which could be the old ratio, equal sacrifice, or a specified ratio. The difficulty arises where the ratio in which the new partner acquires his share from the old partners is not specified. Instead, the new profit sharing ratio is given. In such a situation, the sacrificing ratio is to be worked out by deducting each partner’s new share from his old share. Look at the illustrations 6 to 8 and see how sacrificing ratio is calculated in such a situation. Illustration 6 Rohit and Mohit are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3. They admit Bijoy as a new partner for 1/7 share in the profit.  The new profit sharing ratio will be 4:2:1. Calculate the sacrificing ratio of Rohit and Mohit. Solution 5 Rohit’s old share = 8 4 Rohit’s new share = 7 5 4 3 Rohit’s sacrifice =   8 7 56 3 Mohit’s old share = 8 2 Mohit’s new share = 7 3 2 5 Mohit’s sacrifice =   8 7 56 Sacrificing ratio among Rohit and Mohit will be 3:5. Illustration 7 Amar and Bahadur are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admitted Mary as a new partner for 1/4 share. The new profit sharing ratio between Amar and Bahadur will be 2:1. Calculate their sacrificing ratio. 2024-25 54 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts Solution 1 Mary’s share = 4 1 3 Remaining share = 1 = 4 4 This 3/4 share is to be shared by Amar and Bahadur in the ratio  of 2:1. Therefore, 2 3 6 2 Amar’s new share =  of  =  or 3 4 12 4 1 3 3 1 Bahadur’s new share =  of =  or 3 4 12 4 New profit sharing ratio of Amar, Bahadur and Mary will be 2:1:1. 3 2 2 Amar’s sacrifice =   5 4 20 2 1 3 Bahadur’s sacrifice =   5 4 20 Sacrificing ratio among Amar and Bahadur will be 2:3. Illustration 8 Ramesh and Suresh are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 4:3. They admitted Mohan as a new partner. The profit sharing ratio of Ramesh, Suresh and Mohan will be 2:3:1. Calculate the gain or sacrifice of old partner. Solution 4 Ramesh’s old share = 7 2 Ramesh’s new share = 6 4 2 10 Ramesh’s sacrifice =   7 6 42 3 Suresh’s new share = 6 3 Suresh’s old share = 7 3 3 3 Suresh’s gain =   6 7 42 1 7 Mohan’s share =  or 6 42 2024-25 Admission of a Partner 55 Ramesh’s sacrifice = Suresh’s gain+Mohan’s gain 3 7 10 =   42 42 42 In this case, the whole sacrifice is by Ramesh alone. Test your Understanding - I 1. A and B are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:1. They admit C for 1/4 share in the future profits. The new profit sharing ratio will be: 9 3 4 (a) A , B , C 16 16 16 8 4 4 (b) A , B , C 16 16 16 10 2 4 (c) A , B , C 16 16 16 8 9 10 (d) A , B , C 16 16 16 2. X and Y share profits in the ratio of 3:2. Z was admitted as a partner who sets 1/5 share. New profit sharing ratio, if Z acquires 3/20 from X and 1/20 from Y would be: (a) 9 : 7 : 4 (b) 8 : 8 : 4 (c) 6 : 10 : 4 (d) 10 : 6 : 4 3. A and B share profits and losses in the ratio of 3 : 1, C is admitted into partnership for 1/4 share. The sacrificing ratio of A and B is: (a) equal (b) 3 : 1 (c) 2 : 1 (d) 3 : 2. 2.5 Goodwill Goodwill is also one of the special aspects of partnership accounts which requires adjustment (also valuation if not specified) at the time of reconstitution of a firm viz., a change in the profit sharing ratio, the admission of a partner or the retirement or death of a partner. 2.5.1 Meaning of Goodwill Over a period of time, a well-established business develops an advantage of good name, reputation and wide business connections. This helps the business to earn more profits as compared to a newly set up business. In accounting, the monetary value of such advantage is known as “goodwill”. It is as an intangible asset. In other words, goodwill is the value of the reputation of a firm in respect of the profits expected in future over and above the normal profits. It is generally observed that when a person pays for goodwill, 2024-25 56 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts he/she pays for something, which places him in the position of being able to earn super profits as compared to the profit earned by other firms in the same industry. In simple words, goodwill can be defined as “the present value of a firm’s anticipated excess earnings” or as “the capitalised value attached to the differential profit capacity of a business”. Thus, goodwill exists only when the firm earns super profits. Any firm that earns normal profits or is incurring losses has no goodwill. 2.5.2 Factors Affecting the Value of Goodwill The main factors affecting the value of goodwill are as follows: 1. Nature of business: A firm that produces high value added products or having a stable demand is able to earn more profits and therefore has more goodwill. 2. Location: If the business is centrally located or is at a place having heavy customer traffic, the goodwill tends to be high. 3. Efficiency of management:  A well-managed concern usually enjoys the advantage of high productivity and cost efficiency. This leads to higher profits and so the value of goodwill will also be high. 4. Market situation:  The monopoly condition or limited competition enables the concern to earn high profits which leads to higher value of goodwill. 5. Special advantages:  The firm that enjoys special advantages like import licences, low rate and assured supply of electricity, long-term contracts for supply of materials, well-known collaborators, patents, trademarks, etc. enjoy higher value of goodwill. 2.5.3 Need for Valuation of Goodwill Normally, the need for valuation of goodwill arises at the time of sale of a business. But, in the context of a partnership firm it may also arise in the following circumstances: 1. Change in the profit sharing ratio amongst the existing partners; 2. Admission of new partner; 3. Retirement of a partner; 4. Death of a partner; and 5. Dissolution of a firm involving sale of business as a going concern. 6. Amalgamation of partnership firms. 2.5.4 Methods of Valuation of Goodwill Since goodwill is an intangible asset it is very difficult to accurately calculate its value. Various methods have been advocated for the valuation of goodwill of a partnership firm. Goodwill calculated by one method may differ from the goodwill 2024-25 Admission of a Partner 57 calculated by another method. Hence, the method by which goodwill is to be calculated, may be specifically decided between the existing partners and the incoming partner. The important methods of valuation of goodwill are as follows: 1. Average Profits Method 2. Super Profits Method 3. Capitalisation Method 2.5.4.1 Average Profits Method Under this method, the goodwill is valued at agreed number of ‘years’ purchase of the average profits of the past few years. It is based on the assumption that a new business will not be able to earn any profits during the first few years of its operations. Hence, the person who purchases a running business must pay in the form of goodwill a sum which is equal to the profits he is likely to receive for the first few years. The goodwill, therefore, should be calculated by multiplying the past average profits by the number of years during which the anticipated profits are expected to accrue. For example, if the past average profits of a business works out at Rs. 20,000 and it is expected that such profits are likely to continue for another three years, the value of goodwill will be Rs. 60,000 (Rs. 20,000   3), Illustration 9 The profit for the five years of a firm are as follows – year 2013 Rs. 4,00,000; year 2014 Rs. 3,98,000; year 2015 Rs. 4,50,000; year 2016 Rs. 4,45,000 and year 2017 Rs. 5,00,000. Calculate goodwill of the firm on the basis of 4 years purchase of 5 years average profits. Solution Year Profit (Rs.) 2013 4,00,000 2014 3,98,000 2015 4,50,000 2016 4,45,000 2017 5,00,000 Total 21,93,000 TotalProfit of Last 5 Years 21,93,000 Average Profit =    =  Rs.   =  Rs. 4,38,600 No.of years 5 Goodwill =   Average Profits × No. of years purchased =  Rs. 4,38,600 × 4  = Rs. 17,54,400 2024-25 58 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts The above calculation of goodwill is based on the assumption that no change in the overall situation of profits is expected in the future. The above illustration is based on simple average. Sometimes, if there exists an increasing on decreasing trend, it is considered to be better to give a higher weightage to the profits to the recent years than those of the earlier years. Hence, it is a advisable to work out weighted average based on specified weights like 1, 2, 3, 4 for respective year’s profit. However, weighted average should be used only if specified. (See illustrations 10 and 11). Illustration 10 The profits of firm for the five years are as follows: Year Profit (Rs.) 2012–13 20,000 2013–14 24,000 2014–15 30,000 2015–16 25,000 2016–17 18,000 Calculate the value of goodwill on the basis of three years’ purchase of weighted average profits based on weights 1,2,3,4 and 5 respectively.

The profit of the last four years were:  2012 Rs. 20,200; 2013 Rs. 24,800; 2014 Rs. 20,000 and 2015 Rs. 30,000. The weights assigned to each year are : 2012 – 1; 2013 – 2; 2014 – 3 and 2015 – 4. You are supplied the following information: 1. On September 1, 2014 a major plant repair was undertaken for Rs. 6,000, which was charged to revenue. The said sum is to be capitalised for goodwill calculation subject to adjustment of depreciation of 10% p.a. on reducing balance method. 2. The Closing Stock for the year 2013 was overvalued by Rs. 2,400. 3. To cover management cost an annual charge of Rs. 4,800 should be made for purpose of goodwill valuation.

Hence, the person who purchases an existing business has to pay in the form of goodwill a sum equal to the total profits he is likely to receive for the first ‘few years’. But it is contended that the buyer’s real benefit does not lie in total profits; it is limited to such amounts of profits which are in excess of the normal return on capital employed in similar business. Therefore, it is desirable to value, goodwill on the basis of the excess profits and not the actual profits. The excess of actual profits over the normal profits is termed as super profits. Firm’s Capital × Normal Rate of Return Normal Profit  = 100 Firms capital includes partners capital and reserves and surplus but excludes fictitious assets and goodwill. Suppose an existing firm earns Rs. 18,000 on the capital of Rs. 1,50,000 and the normal rate of return is 10%. The Normal profits will work out at Rs. 15,000 (1,50,000 × 10/100). The super profits in this case will be Rs. 3,000 (Rs. 18,000 – 15,000). The goodwill under the super profit method is ascertained by multiplying the super profits by certain number of years’ purchase. If, in the above example, it is expected that the benefit of super profits is likely to be available for 5 years in future, the goodwill will be valued at Rs. 15,000 (3,000 × 5). Thus, the steps involved under the method are: 1. Calculate the average profit, 2. Calculate the normal profit on the firm’s capital on the basis of the normal rate of return, 3. Calculate the super profits by deducting normal profit from the average profits, and 4. Calculate goodwill by multiplying the super profits by the given number of years’ purchase. 2024-25 Admission of a Partner 61 Illustration 12 The books of a business showed that the firm’s capital employed on December 31, 2015, Rs. 5,00,000 and the profits for the last five years were: 2011–Rs. 40,000: 2012-Rs. 50,000; 2013-Rs. 55,000; 2014Rs.70,000 and 2015-Rs. 85,000. You are required to find out the value of goodwill based on 3 years purchase of the super profits of the business, given that the normal rate of return is 10%. Solution Firm's Capital   Normal Rate of Return Normal Profits  = 100 5,00,000 10 =  Rs.   =  Rs. 50,000 100 Average Profits: Year Profit (Rs.) 2011 40,000 2012 50,000 2013 55,000 2014 70,000 2015 85,000 Total                         3,00,000 Average  Profits =  Rs. 3,00,000/5  = Rs. 60,000 Super Profit =  Rs. 60,000 – Rs. 50,000  =  Rs. 10,000 Goodwill =  Rs. 10,000  3 = Rs. 30,000 Illustration 13 The capital of the firm of Anu and Benu is Rs. 1,00,000 and the market rate of interest is 15%.  Annual salary to partners is Rs. 6,000 each.  The profits for the last 3 years were Rs. 30,000; Rs. 36,000 and Rs. 42,000.  Goodwill is to be valued at 2 years purchase of the last 3 years’ average super profits. Calculate the goodwill of the firm. Solution 15 Interest on capital = 1,00,000  = Rs.   15,000…………(i) 100 Add: partner’s salary = Rs. 6,000 2 = Rs.   12,000…………(ii) 2024-25 62 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts Normal Profit(i+ii) = Rs.   27,000 1,08,000 Average Profit = Rs. 30,000+Rs.36,000+Rs.42,000 = Rs. 3 = Rs. 36,000 Super Profit = Average Profit–Normal Profit = Rs. 36,000–Rs. 27,000 = Rs. 9,000 Goodwill = Super Profit × No of years’ purchase = Rs. 9,000 × 2 = Rs. 18,000 2.5.4.3 Capitalisation Method Under this method the goodwill can be calculated in two ways: (a) by capitalizing the average profits, or (b) by capitalising the super profits. (a) Capitalisation of Average Profits: Under this method, the value of goodwill is ascertained by deducting the actual firm’s capital in the business from the capitalized value of the average profits on the basis of normal rate of return. This involves the following steps: (i) Ascertain the average profits based on the past few years’ performance. (ii) Capitalize the average profits on the basis of the normal rate of return to ascertain the capitalised value of average profits as follows: Average Profits × 100/Normal Rate of Return (iii) Ascertain the actual firm’s capital (net assets) by deducting outside liabilities from the total assets (excluding goodwill and ficticious assets). Firms’ Capital = Total Assets (excluding goodwill) – Outside Liabilities Where outside Liabilities include both long term and short term Liabilities. (iv) Compute the value of goodwill by deducting net assets from the capitalised value of average profits, i.e. (ii) – (iii). Illustration 14 A business has earned average profits of Rs. 1,00,000 during the last few years and the normal rate of return in a similar business is 10%. Ascertain the value of goodwill by capitalisation average profits method, given that the value of net assets of the business is Rs. 8,20,000. Solution Capitalised Value of Average Profits 1,00,000 100 Rs.  = Rs. 10,00,000 10 2024-25 Admission of a Partner 63 Goodwill = Capitalised value – Net Assets = Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 8,20,000 = Rs.1,80,000 (b) Capitalisation of Super Profits: Goodwill can also be ascertained by capitalising the super profit directly. Under this method there is no need to work out the capitalised value of average profits. It involves the following steps. (i) Calculate capital of the firm, which is equal to total assets (excluding goodwill and ficticious assets) minus outside liabilities. (ii) Calculate normal profits on capital employed. (iii) Calculate average profit for past years, as specified. (ii) Calculate super profits by deducting normal profits from average profits. (iii) Multiply the super profits by the required rate of return multiplier, that is, Goodwill = Super Profits × 100 Normal Rate of Return In other words, goodwill is the capitalised value of super profits. The amount of goodwill worked out by this method will be exactly the same as calculated by capitalising the average profits. For example, using the data given in illustration 14 where the average profits are Rs. 1,00,000 and the normal profits are Rs. 82,000 (10% of Rs. 8,20,000), the super profits worked out as Rs. 18,000 (Rs. 1,00,000 – Rs. 82,000), the goodwill will be calculated as follows. 100 Rs. 18,000 ×  = Rs. 1,80,000. 10 Illustration 15 1. The goodwill of a firm is to be worked out at three years’ purchase of the average profits of the last five years which are as follows: Years Profits (Loss) (Rs.) 2012 10,000 2013 15,000 2014 4,000
