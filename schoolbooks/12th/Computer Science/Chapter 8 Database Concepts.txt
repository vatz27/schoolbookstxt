Chapter 8 Database  Concepts “Inconsistency of your mind… Can damage your memory… Remove the inconsistent data… And keep the original one !!!” — Nisarga Jain In this Chapter » Introduction » File System » Database Management System 8.1 IntroductIon » Rational Data Model After learning about importance of data in the » Keys in a Relational previous chapter, we need to explore the methods Database to store and manage data electronically. Let us take an example of a school that maintains data about its students, along with their attendance record and guardian details. The class teacher marks daily attendance of the students in the attendance register. The teacher records ‘P’ for present or ‘A’ for absent against each student’s roll number on each working day. If class strength is 50 and total working days in a month are 26, the teacher needs to record 50 × 26 records manually in the register every month. As the volume of data increases, manual data entry becomes tedious. Following are some of the limitations of manual record keeping in this example: 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   111 18-Jun-21   2:34:58 PM Activity 8.1 1) Entry of student details (Roll number and name) in the new attendance register when the student is Visit a few shops where records are maintained promoted to the next class. manually and identify 2) Writing student details on each month’s attendance a few limitations of page where inconsistency may happen due to manual record keeping faced by incorrectly written names, skipped student them.  records, etc. 3) Loss of data in case attendance register is lost or damaged. 4) Erroneous calculation while consolidating attendance record manually. The office staff also manually maintain student details viz. Roll Number, Name and Date of Birth with respective guardian details viz. Guardian name, Contact Number and Address. This is required for correspondence with guardian regarding student attendance and result. Finding information from a huge volume of papers or deleting/modifying an entry is a difficult task in pen and paper based approach. To overcome the hassles faced in manual record keeping, it is desirable to store attendance record and student details on separate data files on a computerised system, so that office staff and teachers can: 1) Simply copy the student details to the new attendance file from the old attendance file when students are promoted to next class. 2) Find any data about student or guardian. 3) Add more details to existing data whenever a new student joins the school. 4) Modify stored data like details of student or guardian whenever required. 5) Remove/delete data whenever a student leaves the school. 8.2 FIle SyStem A file can be understood as a container to store data in a computer. Files can be stored on the storage device of a computer system. Contents of a file can be texts, computer program code, comma separated values (CSV), etc. Likewise, pictures, audios/videos, web pages are also files. Files stored on a computer can be accessed directly and searched for desired data. But to access data of a 112 Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   112 18-Jun-21   2:34:59 PM file through software, for example, to display monthly attendance report on school website, one has to write computer programs to access data from files. Continuing the example of attendance at school, we need to store data about students and attendance in two separate files. Table 8.1 shows the contents of STUDENT file which has six columns, as detailed below: RollNumber – Roll number of the student SName  – Name of the student SDateofBirth –  Date of birth of the student GName  –  Name of the guardian GPhone  – Phone number of the student guardian GAddress  –  Address of the guardian of the student Table 8.1 STUDENT file maintained by office staff Roll Number SName SDateof Birth GName GPhone GAddress 1 Atharv Ahuja 2003-05-15 Amit Ahuja 5711492685 G-35, Ashok Vihar, Delhi 2 Daizy Bhutia 2002-02-28 Baichung 7110047139 Flat no. 5, Darjeeling Bhutia Appt., Shimla 3 Taleem Shah 2002-02-28 Himanshu Shah 9818184855 26/77, West Patel Nagar, Ahmedabad 4 John Dsouza 2003-08-18 Danny Dsouza S -13, Ashok Village, Daman 5 Ali Shah 2003-07-05 Himanshu Shah 9818184855 26/77, West Patel Nagar, Ahmedabad 6 Manika P. 2002-03-10 Sujata P. 7802983674 HNO-13, B- block, Preet Vihar, Madurai Table 8.2 shows another file called ATTENDANCE which has four columns, as detailed below: AttendanceDate  –  Date for which attendance was marked RollNumber  –  Roll number of the student SName –  Name of the student AttendanceStatus –  Marked as P (present) or A (absent) Table 8.2 ATTENDANCE file maintained by class teacher AttendanceDate RollNumber SName AttendanceStatus 2018-09-01 1 Atharv Ahuja P 2018-09-01 2 Daizy Bhutia P 2018-09-01 3 Taleem Shah A 2018-09-01 4 John Dsouza P 2018-09-01 5 Ali Shah A 2018-09-01 6 Manika P.

P 8.2.1 Limitations of a File System File system becomes difficult to handle when number of files increases and volume of data also grows. Following are some of the limitations of file system: (A) Difficulty in Access Files themselves do not provide any mechanism to retrieve data. Data maintained in a file system are accessed through application programs. While writing such programs, the developer may not anticipate all the possible ways in which data may be accessed. So, sometimes it is difficult to access data in the required format and one has to write application program to access data. (B) Data Redundancy Redundancy means same data are duplicated in different places (files). In our example, student names are maintained in both the files. Besides, in Table 8.1, students with roll numbers 3 and 5 have same guardian name and therefore same guardian name is maintained twice. Both these are examples of redundancy which is difficult to avoid in a file system. Redundancy leads to excess storage use and may cause data inconsistency also. (C) Data Inconsistency Data inconsistency occurs when same data maintained in different places do not match. If a student wants to get changed the spelling of her name, it needs to be changed in SName column in both the files. Likewise, if a student leaves school, the details need to be deleted from both the files. As the files are being maintained by different people, the changes may not happen in one of the files. In that case, the student name will be different (inconsistent) in both the files. (D) Data Isolation Both the files presented at Table 8.1 (STUDENT) and at Table 8.2 (ATTENDANCE) are related to students. But 114 Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   114 18-Jun-21   2:34:59 PM there is no link or mapping between them. The school noteS will have to write separate programs to access these two files. This is because data mapping is not supported in file system. In a more complex system where data files are generated by different person at different times, files being created in isolation may be of different formats. In such case, it is difficult to write new application programs to retrieve data from different files maintained at multiple places, as one has to understand the underlying structure of each file as well. (E) Data Dependence Data are stored in a specific format or structure in a file. If the structure or format itself is changed, all the existing application programs accessing that file also need to be changed. Otherwise, the programs may not work correctly. This is data dependency. Hence, updating the structure of a data file requires modification in all the application programs accessing that file. (F) Controlled Data Sharing There can be different category of users like teacher, office staff and parents. Ideally, not every user should be able to access all the data. As an example, guardians and office staff can only see the student attendance data but should not be able to modify/delete it. It means these users should be given limited access (read only) to the ATTENDANCE file. Only the teacher should be able to update the attendance data. It is very difficult to enforce this kind of access control in a file system while accessing files through application programs. 8.3 databaSe management SyStem Limitations faced in file system can be overcome by storing the data in a database where data are logically related. We can organise related data in a database so that it can be managed in an efficient and easy way. A database management system (DBMS) or database system in short, is a software that can be used to create and manage databases. DBMS lets users to create a database, store, manage, update/modify and retrieve data from that database by users or application programs. Some examples of open source and commercial DBMS include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Microsoft Access, MongoDB. Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 115 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   115 18-Jun-21   2:34:59 PM A database system hides certain details about how data are actually stored and maintained. Thus, Some database it provides users with an abstract view of the data.

In addition, line interface that requires users to users can modify the structure of the database itself use programming through a DBMS. commands to Databases are widely used in various fields.

Let us now design a database to store data of those two files. We know that tables in a database are linked or related through one or more common columns or fields. In our example, the STUDENT (Table 8.1) file and ATTENDANCE (Table 8.2) file have RollNumber and SName as common field names. In order to convert these two files into a database, we need to incorporate the following changes: a) SName need not be maintained in ATTENDANCE file as it is already there in STUDENT. Details for a student can be retrieved through the common field RollNumber in both the files. 116 Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   116 18-Jun-21   2:34:59 PM b) If two siblings are in the same class, then same guardian details (GName, GPhone and GAddress) are maintained for both the siblings. We know this is a redundancy and by using a database we can avoid this. So let us split the STUDENT file into two High Cost is incurred file (STUDENT file and GUARDIAN) file so that each while shifting from file guardian data are maintained only once. system to DBMS: c) One and more guardians can have the same name. • Purchasing sophisticated So it will not be possible to identify which guardian hardware and is related to which student.

But, phone number can change, and therefore may not truly distinguish guardian. Figure 8.1 shows the related data files for the STUDENT, GUARDIAN and ATTENDANCE details.

As shown here, the DBMS maintains a single repository of data at a centralised location and can be used by multiple users (office staff, teacher) at the same time. 8.3.2 Key Concepts in DBMS In order to efficiently manage data using a DBMS, let us understand certain key terms: (A) Database Schema Database Schema is the design of a database. It is the skeleton of the database that represents the structure (table names and their fields/columns), the type of data each column can hold, constraints on the data to be stored (if any), and the relationships among the tables. Database schema is also called the visual or logical architecture as it tells us how the data are organised in a database. 118 Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   118 3/31/2023   2:36:20 PM Teacher Office Staff DBMS Software processes Query DBMS Software access database and its definition Student Database Guardian Catalog Attendance Figure 8.2: STUDENTATTENDANCE database environment (B) Data Constraint Sometimes we put certain restrictions or limitations on the type of data that can be inserted in one or more columns of a table. This is done by specifying one or more constraints on that column(s) while creating the tables. For example, one can define the constraint that the column mobile number can only have non-negative integer values of exactly 10 digits. Since each student shall have one unique roll number, we can put the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints on the RollNumber column. Constraints are used to ensure accuracy and reliability of data in the database. (C) Meta-data or Data Dictionary The database schema along with various constraints on the data is stored by DBMS in a database catalog or dictionary, called meta-data. A meta-data is data about the data. (D) Database Instance When we define database structure or schema, state of database is empty i.e. no data entry is there. After loading data, the state or snapshot of the database at any given time is the database instance. We may then retrieve data through queries or manipulate data Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 119 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   119 18-Jun-21   2:34:59 PM Query Result Query Query Result Que ry through updation, modification or deletion. Thus, the state of database can change, and thus a database schema can have many instances at different times. (E) Query A query is a request to a database for obtaining information in a desired way. Query can be made to get data from one table or from a combination of tables. For example, “find names of all those students present on Attendance Date 2000-01-02” is a query to the database. To retrieve or manipulate data, the user needs to write query using a query language called, which is discussed in chapter 8. Limitations of DBMS Increased Complexity: (F) Data Manipulation Use of DBMS Modification of database consists of three operations increases the viz. Insertion, Deletion or Update. Suppose, Rivaan joins complexity of as a new student in the class then the student details maintaining need to be added in STUDENT as well as in GUARDIAN functionalities like files of the Student Attendance database. This is called security, consistency, sharing and integrit y Insertion operation on the database. In case a student leaves the school, then his/her data as well as her Increased data guardian details need to be removed from STUDENT, vulnerability: GUARDIAN and ATTENDANCE files, respectively. This As data are stored is called Deletion operation on the database. Suppose centrally, it increases the chances of loss Atharv’s Guardian has changed his mobile number, his of data due to any GPhone should be updated in GUARDIAN file. This is failure of hardware or called Update operation on the database. software. It can bring all operations to a halt (G) Database Engine for all the users. Database engine is the underlying component or set of programs used by a DBMS to create database and handle various queries for data retrieval and manipulation. 8.4 relatIonal data model Different types of DBMS are available and their classification is done based on the underlying data model. A data model describes the structure of the database, including how data are defined and represented, relationships among data, and the constraints. The most commonly used data model is Relational Data Model. Other types of data models include object-oriented data model, entity-relationship data model, document model and hierarchical data model. This book discusses the DBMS based on relational data model. In relational model, tables are called relations that store data for different columns. Each table can have 120 Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   120 18-Jun-21   2:34:59 PM multiple columns where each column name should be unique. For example, each row in the table represents a related set of values. Each row of Table 8.5 represents a particular guardian and has related values viz. guardian’s ID with guardian name, address and phone number. Thus, a table consists of a collection of relationships. It is important to note here that relations in a database are not independent tables, but are associated with each other. For example, relation ATTENDANCE has attribute RollNumber which links it with corresponding student record in relation STUDENT. Similarly, attribute GUID is placed with STUDENT table for extracting guardian details of a particular student. If linking attributes are not there in appropriate relations, it will not be possible to keep the database in correct state and retrieve valid information from the database. Figure 8.3 shows the relational database Student Attendance along with the three relations (tables) STUDENT, ATTENDANCE and GUARDIAN. Figure 8.3: Representing STUDENTATTENDANCE database using Relational Data Model Table 8.7 Relation schemas along with its description of Student Attendance database Relation Scheme Description of attributes STUDENT(RollNumber, RollNumber: unique id of the student SName, SDateofBirth, SName: name of the student GUID) SDateofBirth: date of  birth of the student GUID: unique id of the guardian of the student ATTENDANCE AttendanceDate: date on which attendance is taken (AttendanceDate, RollNumber: roll number of the student RollNumber, AttendanceStatus: whether present (P) or absent(A) AttendanceStatus) Note that combination of AttendanceDate and RollNumber will be unique in each record of the table GUARDIAN(GUID, GUID: unique id of the guardian GName, GPhone, GName: name of the guardian GAddress) GPhone: contact number of the guardian GAddress: contact address of the guardian Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 121 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   121 18-Jun-21   2:34:59 PM Each tuple (row) in a relation (table) corresponds to data of a real world entity (for example, Student, Guardian, and Attendance). In the GUARDIAN relation (Table 8.5), each row represents the facts about the guardian and each column name in the GUARDIAN table is used to interpret the meaning of data stored under that column. A database that is modeled on relational data model concept is called Relational Database. Figure 8.4 shows relation GUARDIAN with some populated data. Let us now understand the commonly used terminologies in relational data model using Figure 8.4. Relation GuaRdian with 4 attribute/ columns GUID GName GPhone GAddress 444444444444 Amit Ahuja 5711492685 G-35, Ashok Vihar, Delhi 111111111111 Baichung Bhutia 3612967082 Flat no. 5, Darjeeling Appt., Shimla 101010101010 Himanshu Shah 4726309212 26/77, West Patel Nagar, Ahmedabad 333333333333 Danny Dsouza S -13, Ashok Village, Daman 466444444666 Sujata P. 3801923168 HNO-13, B- block, Preet Vihar, Madurai Facts about RELATION GUARDIAN: 1. Degree (Number of attributes) = 4 Record/tuple/row 2. Cardinality (Number of rows/tuples/records) = 5 3. Relation is a flat file i.e, each column has a single value and each record has same number of columns Figure 8.4: Relation GuaRdian with its attributes and tuples i) ATTRIBUTE: Characteristic or parameters for which data are to be stored in a relation. Simply stated, the columns of a relation are the attributes which are also referred as fields. For example, GUID, GName, GPhone and GAddress are attributes of relation GUARDIAN. ii) TUPLE: Each row of data in a relation (table) is called a tuple. In a table with n columns, a tuple is a relationship between the n related values. iii) DOMAIN:  It is a set of values from which an attribute can take a value in each row. Usually, a data type is used to specify domain for an attribute. For example, in STUDENT relation, the attribute RollNumber takes integer values and hence its domain is a set of integer values. Similarly, the set of character strings constitutes the domain of the attribute SName. iv) DEGREE: The number of attributes in a relation is called the Degree of the relation. For example, relation GUARDIAN with four attributes is a relation of degree 4. 122 Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   122 3/31/2023   2:24:34 PM Relation State v) CARDINALITY: The number of tuples in a relation noteS is called the Cardinality of the relation. For example, the cardinality of relation GUARDIAN is 5 as there are 5 tuples in the table. 8.4.1 Three Important Properties of a Relation In relational data model, following three properties are observed with respect to a relation which makes a relation different from a data file or a simple table. Property 1: imposes following rules on an attribute of the relation. • Each attribute in a relation has a unique name. • Sequence of attributes in a relation is immaterial. Property 2: governs following rules on a tuple of a relation. • Each tuple in a relation is distinct. For example, data values in no two tuples of relation ATTENDANCE can be identical for all the attributes. Thus, each tuple of a relation must be uniquely identified by its contents. • Sequence of tuples in a relation is immaterial. The tuples are not considered to be ordered, even though they appear to be in tabular form. Property 3: imposes following rules on the state of a relation. • All data values in an attribute must be from the same domain (same data type). • Each data value associated with an attribute must be atomic (cannot be further divisible into meaningful subparts). For example, GPhone of relation GUARDIAN has ten digit numbers which is indivisible. • No attribute can have many data values in one tuple. For example, Guardian cannot specify multiple contact numbers under GPhone attribute. • A special value “NULL” is used to represent values that are unknown or non-applicable to certain attributes. For example, if a guardian does not share his or her contact number with the school authorities, then GPhone is set to NULL (data unknown). 8.5 KeyS In a relatIonal databaSe The tuples within a relation must be distinct. It means no two tuples in a table should have same value for all attributes. That is, there should be at least one attribute Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 123 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   123 18-Jun-21   2:35:00 PM noteS in which data are distinct (unique) and not NULL. That way, we can uniquely distinguish each tuple of a relation. So, relational data model imposes some restrictions or constraints on the values of the attributes and how the contents of one relation be referred through another relation. These restrictions are specified at the time of defining the database through different types of keys as given below: 8.5.1 Candidate Key A relation can have one or more attributes that takes distinct values. Any of these attributes can be used to uniquely identify the tuples in the relation. Such attributes are called candidate keys as each of them are candidates for the primary key. As shown in Figure 8.4, the relation GUARDIAN has four attributes out of which GUID and GPhone always take unique values. No two guardians will have same phone number or same GUID. Hence, these two attributes are the candidate keys as they both are candidates for primary key. 8.5.2 Primary Key Out of one or more candidate keys, the attribute chosen by the database designer to uniquely identify the tuples in a relation is called the primary key of that relation. The remaining attributes in the list of candidate keys are called the alternate keys. In the relation GUARDIAN, suppose GUID is chosen as primary key, then GPhone will be called the alternate key. 8.5.3 Composite Primary Key If no single attribute in a relation is able to uniquely distinguish the tuples, then more than one attribute are taken together as primary key. Such primary key consisting of more than one attribute is called Composite Primary key. In relation ATTENDANCE, Roll Number cannot be used as primary key as roll number of same student will appear in another row for a different date. Similarly, in relation Attendance, AttendanceDate cannot be used as primary key because same date is repeated for each roll number. However combination of these two attributes RollNumber and AttendanceDate together would always have unique value in ATTENDANCE table as on any working day, of  a student would be 124 Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   124 18-Jun-21   2:35:00 PM marked attendance only once. Hence {RollNumber, AttendanceDate} will make the of ATTENDANCE relation composite primary key. 8.5.4 Foreign Key A foreign key is used to represent the relationship between two relations. A foreign key is an attribute whose value is derived from the primary key of another relation. This means that any attribute of a relation (referencing), which is used to refer contents from another (referenced) relation, becomes foreign key if it refers to the primary key of referenced relation. The referencing relation is called Foreign Relation. In some cases, foreign key can take NULL value if it is not the part of primary key of the foreign table. The relation in which the referenced primary key is defined is called primary relation or master relation. In Figure 8.5, two foreign keys in Student Attendance database are shown using schema diagram where the foreign key is displayed as a directed arc (arrow) originating from it and ending at the corresponding attribute of the primary key of the referenced table.  The underlined attributes make the primary key of that table. STUDENT RollNumber SName SDateofBirth GUID GUARDIAN GUID GName GPhone GAddress ATTENDANCE AttendanceDate RollNumber AttendanceStatus Figure 8.5: STUDENTATTENDANCE database with the primary and foreign keys Summary • A file in a file system is a container to store data in a computer. • File system suffers from Data Redundancy, Data Inconsistency, Data Isolation, Data Dependence and Controlled Data sharing. • Database Management System (DBMS) is a software to create and manage databases.

What are the limitations of file system that can be overcome by a relational DBMS? 6. A school has a rule that each student must participate in a sports activity. So each one should give only one preference for sports activity. Suppose there are five students in a class, each having a unique roll number. The class representative has prepared a list of sports preferences as shown below. Answer the following: Table: Sports Preferences Roll_no Preference 9 Cricket 13 Football 17 Badminton 17 Football 21 Hockey 24 NULL NULL Kabaddi a) Roll no 24 may not be interested in sports. Can a NULL value be assigned to that student’s preference field? b) Roll no 17 has given two preferences in sports. Which property of relational DBMC is violated here? Can we use any constraint or key in the relational DBMS to check against such violation, if any? c) Kabaddi was not chosen by any student. Is it possible to have this tuple in the Sports Preferences relation? 7. In another class having 2 sections, the two respective class representatives have prepared 2 separate Sports Preferences tables, as shown below: Sports preference of section 1 (arranged on roll number column) Table: Sports Preferences Roll_no Sports 9 Cricket 13 Football 17 Badminton 21 Hockey 24 Cricket Sports preference of section 2 (arranged on Sports name column, and column order is also different) Computer SCienCe - ClaSS Xii DatabaSe ConCeptS 127 2024-25 Chpater-8.indd   127 07-Sep-21   4:48:16 PM noteS Table: Sports Preferences Sports Roll_no Badminton 17 Cricket 9 Cricket 24 Football 13 Hockey 21 Are the states of both the relations equivalent?
