Chapter 2 Theory of Consumer Behaviour In this chapter, we will study the behaviour of an individual consumer. The consumer has to decide how to spend her income on different goods1. Economists call this the problem of choice. Most naturally, any consumer will want to get a combination of goods that gives her maximum satisfaction. What will be this ‘best’ combination? This depends on the likes of the consumer and what the consumer can afford to buy. The ‘likes’ of the consumer are also called ‘preferences’. And what the consumer can afford to buy, depends on prices of the goods and the income of the consumer. This chapter presents two different approaches that explain consumer behaviour (i) Cardinal Utility Analysis and (ii) Ordinal Utility Analysis. Preliminary Notations and Assumptions A consumer, in general, consumes many goods; but for simplicity, we shall consider the consumer’s choice problem in a situation where there are only two goods2: bananas and mangoes. Any combination of the amount of the two goods will be called a consumption bundle or, in short, a bundle. In general, we shall use the variable x  to denote the quantity of bananas and x to 1 2 denote the quantity of mangoes. x  and x  can be positive or zero. 1 2 (x x ) would mean the bundle consisting of x  quantity of bananas 1, 2 1 and x  quantity of mangoes. For particular values of x  and x , (x , 2 1 2 1 x ), would give us a particular bundle. For example, the bundle 2 (5,10) consists of 5 bananas and 10 mangoes; the bundle (10, 5) consists of 10 bananas and 5 mangoes. 2.1 UTILITY A consumer usually decides his demand for a commodity on the basis of utility (or satisfaction) that he derives from it. What is utility? Utility of a commodity is its want-satisfying capacity. The more the need of a commodity or the stronger the desire to have it, the greater is the utility derived from the commodity. Utility is subjective. Different individuals can get different levels of utility from the same commodity. For example, some one who 1We shall use the term goods to mean goods as well as services. 2The assumption that there are only two goods simplifies the analysis considerably and allows us to understand some important concepts by using simple diagrams. Reprint 2024-25 likes chocolates will get much higher utility from a chocolate than some one who is not so fond of chocolates, Also, utility that one individual gets from the commodity can change with change in place and time. For example, utility from the use of a room heater will depend upon whether the individual is in Ladakh or Chennai (place) or whether it is summer or winter (time). 2.1.1 Cardinal Utility Analysis Cardinal utility analysis assumes that level of utility can be expressed in numbers. For example, we can measure the utility derived from a shirt and say, this shirt gives me 50 units of utility. Before discussing further, it will be useful to have a look at two important measures of utility. Measures of Utility Total Utility: Total utility of a fixed quantity of a commodity (TU) is the total satisfaction derived from consuming the given amount of some commodity x. More of commodity x provides more satisfaction to the consumer. TU depends on the quantity of the commodity consumed. Therefore, TU  refers to total utility n derived from consuming n units of a commodity x. Marginal Utility: Marginal utility (MU) is the change in total utility due to consumption of one additional unit of a commodity. For example, suppose 4 bananas give us 28 units of total utility and 5 bananas give us 30 units of total utility. Clearly, consumption of the 5th banana has caused total utility to increase by 2 units (30 units minus 28 units). Therefore,  marginal utility of the 5th banana is 2 units. MU  =  TU  – TU  = 30 – 28 = 2 5 5 4 In general, MU  = TU  – TU , where subscript n refers to the nth unit of the n n n-1 commodity Total utility and marginal utility can also be related in the following way. TU  = MU  + MU  + … + MU  + MU n 1 2 n-1 n This simply means that TU derived from consuming n units of bananas is the sum total of marginal utility of first banana (MU ), marginal utility of second 9 1 banana (MU ), and so on, till the marginal utility of the nth unit. 2 Table No. 2.1 and Figure 2.1 show an imaginary example of the values of marginal and total utility derived from consumption of various amounts of a commodity. Usually, it is seen that the marginal utility diminishes with increase in consumption of the commodity. This happens because having obtained some amount of the commodity, the desire of the consumer to have still more of it becomes weaker. The same is also shown in the table and graph. Table 2.1: Values of marginal and total utility derived from consumption of various amounts of a commodity Units     Total Utility     Marginal Utility 1 12 12 2 18   6 3 22   4 4 24   2 5 24   0 6 22  -2 Reprint 2024-25 Theory of Consumer Behaviour Notice that MU  is less than 3 MU . You may also notice that 2 total utility increases but at a diminishing rate: The rate of change in total utility due to change in quantity of commodity consumed is a measure of marginal utility. This marginal utility diminishes with increase in consumption of the commodity from 12 to 6, 6 to 4 The values of marginal and total utility derived and so on. This follows from the from consumption of various amounts of a law of diminishing marginal commodity. The marginal utility diminishes with utility. Law of Diminishing increase in consumption of the commodity. Marginal Utility states that marginal utility from consuming each additional unit of a commodity declines as its consumption increases, while keeping consumption of other commodities constant. MU becomes zero at a level when TU remains constant. In the example, TU does not change at 5th unit of consumption and therefore MU = 0. Thereafter, 5 TU starts falling and MU becomes negative. Derivation of Demand Curve in the Case of a Single Commodity (Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility) Cardinal utility analysis can be used to derive demand curve for a commodity. What is demand and what is demand curve? The quantity of a commodity that a consumer is willing to buy and is able to afford, given prices of goods and income of the consumer, is called demand for that commodity. Demand for a commodity x, apart from the price of x itself, depends on factors such as prices of other commodities (see substitutes and complements 2.4.4), income of the 10 consumer and tastes and preferences of the consumers. Demand curve is a graphic presentation of various quantities of a commodity that a consumer is willing to buy at different prices of the same commodity, while holding constant prices of other related commodities and income of the consumer. Figure 2.2 presents hypothetical demand curve of an individual for commodity x at its different prices. Quantity is measured along the horizontal axis and price is measured along the vertical axis. The downward sloping demand curve shows that at lower prices, the individual is willing to buy more of commodity x; at higher prices, she is willing to buy less of commodity x. Demand curve of an individual for Therefore, there is a negative commodity x relationship between price of a commodity and quantity demanded which is referred to as the Law of Demand. An explaination for a downward sloping demand curve rests on the notion of diminishing marginal utility. The law of diminishing marginal utility states that each successive unit of a commodity provides lower marginal utility. Reprint 2024-25 Introductory Microeconomics Therefore the individual will not be willing to pay as much for each additional unit and this results in a downward sloping demand curve. At a price of Rs. 40 per unit x, individual’s demand for x was 5 units. The 6th unit of commodity x will be worth less than the 5th unit. The individual will be willing to buy the 6th unit only when the price drops below Rs. 40 per unit. Hence, the law of diminishing marginal utility explains why demand curves have a negative slope. 2.1.2 Ordinal Utility Analysis Cardinal utility analysis is simple to understand, but suffers from a major drawback in the form of quantification of utility in numbers. In real life, we never express utility in the form of numbers. At the most, we can rank various alternative combinations in terms of having more or less utility. In other words, the consumer does not measure utility in numbers, though she often ranks various consumption bundles. This forms the starting point of this topic – Ordinal Utility Analysis. A consumer’s preferences over the set of available bundles can often be represented diagrammatically. We have already seen that the bundles available to the consumer can be plotted as points in a two- A dimensional diagram. The points representing bundles which give the consumer equal utility can generally be joined to obtain a curve like the one in Figure 2.3. The consumer is said to be indifferent on the different bundles because each point of the bundles give the consumer equal utility.  Such a curve joining all points representing bundles among which Indifference curve. An indifference curve joins the consumer is indifferent is called 11 all points representing bundles which are an indifference curve. All the points considered indifferent by the consumer. such as A, B, C and D lying on an indifference curve provide the consumer with the same level of satisfaction. It is clear that when a consumer gets one more banana, he has to forego some mangoes, so that her total utility level remains the same and she remains on the same indifference curve. Therefore, indifference curve slopes downward. The amount of mangoes that the consumer has to forego, in order to get an additional banana, her total utility level being the same, is called marginal rate of substitution (MRS). In other words, MRS is simply the rate at which the consumer will substitute bananas for mangoes, so that her total utility remains constant. So, MRS =| ∆Y / ∆X | 3. One can notice that, in the table 2.2, as we increase the quantity of bananas, the quantity of mangoes sacrificed for each additional banana declines. In other words, MRS diminishes with increase in the number of bananas. As the number 3 | ∆Y / ∆X |= ∆Y / ∆X if (∆Y / ∆X ) ≥0 = −∆Y / ∆X if (∆Y / ∆X ) < 0 MRS =| ∆Y / ∆X | means that MRS equals only the magnitude of the expression ∆Y / ∆X . If ∆Y / ∆X = −3 /1  it means MRS=3.

Similarly, with the fall in quantity of mangoes, the marginal utility derived from mangoes increases. So, with increase in the number of bananas, the consumer will feel the inclination to sacrifice small and smaller amounts of mangoes. This tendency for the MRS to fall with increase in quantity of bananas is known as Law of Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution. This can be seen from figure 2.3 also. Going from point A to point B, the consumer sacrifices 3 mangoes for 1 banana, going from point B to point C, the consumer sacrifices 2 mangoes for 1 banana, and going from point C to point D, the consumer sacrifices just 1 mango for 1 banana. Thus, it is clear that the consumer sacrifices smaller and smaller quantities of mangoes for each additional banana. Shape of an Indifference Curve It may be mentioned that the law of Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution causes an indifference curve to be convex to the origin. This is the most common shape of an indifference curve. But in case of goods being perfect substitutes4, the marginal rate of substitution does not diminish. It remains the same. Let’s take an example. Table 2.3: Representation of Law of Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution 12     Combination             Quantity of five                      Quantity of five               MRS Rupees notes (Qx)                 Rupees coins  (Qy) A                                    1                                               8                                 B                                    2                                               7                               1:1 C                                    3                                               6                                1:1 D                                   4                                                5                               1:1 Here, the consumer is indifferent for all these combinations as long as the total of five rupee coins and five rupee notes remains the same. For the consumer, it hardly matters whether she gets a five rupee coin or a five rupee note. So, irrespective of how many five rupee notes she has, the consumer will sacrifice only one five rupee coin for a five rupee note. So these two commodities are perfect substitutes for the consumer and indifference curve depicting these will be a straight line. In the figure.2.4, it can be seen that consumer sacrifices the same number of five-rupee coins each time he has an additional five-rupee note. 4 Perfect Substitutes are the goods which can be used in place of each other, and provide exactly the same level of utility to the consumer.

Combinations A, B and C consist of same quantity of mangoes but different quantities of bananas. Since combination B has more bananas than A, B will provide the individual a higher level of satisfaction than A. Therefore, B will lie on a higher indifference curve than A, depicting higher satisfaction. Likewise, C has more bananas than B (quantity of mangoes is the same in both B and C). Therefore, C will provide higher level of satisfaction than B, and also lie on a higher indifference curve than B. A higher indifference curve 14 consisting of combinations with Higher indifference curves give greater level more of mangoes, or more of of utility. bananas, or more of both, will represent combinations that give higher level of satisfaction. 3.Two indifference curves never intersect each other: Two indifference curves intersecting each other will lead to conflicting results. To explain this, let us allow two indifference curves to intersect each other as shown in the figure 2.8. As points A and B lie on the A (7,10) same indifference curve IC , utilities 1 derived from combination A and B (9,7) IC1 combination B will give the same C (9,5) level of satisfaction. Similarly, as Ic2 points A and C lie on the same Bananas indifference curve IC , utility 2 8 derived from combination A and from combination C will give the Two indifference curves never intersect same level of satisfaction. each other Reprint 2024-25 Introductory Microeconomics Mangoes From this, it follows that utility from point B and from point C will also be the same. But this is clearly an absurd result, as on point B, the consumer gets a greater number of mangoes with the same quantity of bananas. So consumer is better off at point B than at point C. Thus, it is clear that intersecting indifference curves will lead to conflicting results. Thus, two indifference curves cannot intersect each other. 2.2 THE CONSUMER’S BUDGET Let us consider a consumer who has only a fixed amount of money (income) to spend on two goods. The prices of the goods are given in the market. The consumer cannot buy any and every combination of the two goods that she may want to consume. The consumption bundles that are available to the consumer depend on the prices of the two goods and the income of the consumer. Given her fixed income and the prices of the two goods, the consumer can afford to buy only those bundles which cost her less than or equal to her income. 2.2.1 Budget Set and Budget Line Suppose the income of the consumer is M and the prices of bananas and mangoes are p  and p respectively5. If the consumer wants to buy x  quantities of bananas, 1 2 1 she will have to spend p x  amount of money. Similarly, if the consumer wants 1 1 to buy x  quantities of mangoes, she will have to spend p x  amount of money. 2 2 2 Therefore, if the consumer wants to buy the bundle consisting of x  quantities of 1 bananas and x  quantities of mangoes, she will have to spend p x  + p x  amount 2 1 1 2 2 of money. She can buy this bundle only if she has at least p x  + p x  amount of 1 1 2 2 money. Given the prices of the goods and the income of a consumer, she can choose any bundle as long as it costs less than or equal to the income she has. In other words, the consumer can buy any bundle (x , x ) such that 1 2 p x  + p x  ≤ M     (2.1) 15 1 1 2 2 The inequality (2.1) is called the consumer’s budget constraint. The set of bundles available to the consumer is called the budget set. The budget set is thus the collection of all bundles that the consumer can buy with her income at the prevailing market prices. EXAMPLE  2.1 Consider, for example, a consumer who has Rs 20, and suppose, both the goods are priced at Rs 5 and are available only in integral units. The bundles that this consumer can afford to buy are: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1) and (4, 0). Among these bundles, (0, 4), (1,3), (2, 2), (3, 1) and (4, 0) cost exactly Rs 20 and all the other bundles cost less than Rs 20. The consumer cannot afford to buy bundles like (3, 3) and (4, 5) because they cost more than Rs 20 at the prevailing prices. 5 Price of a good is the amount of money that the consumer has to pay per unit of the good she wants to buy. If rupee is the unit of money and quantity of the good is measured in kilograms, the price of banana being p means the consumer has to pay p rupees per kilograms of banana that she 1 1 wants to buy. Reprint 2024-25 Theory of Consumer Behaviour If both the goods are perfectly divisible6, the consumer’s budget set would consist of all bundles (x , x ) 1 2 such that x  and x  are any numbers 1 2 greater than or equal to 0 and p x  + 1 1 p x  ≤ M. The budget set can be 2 2 represented in a diagram as in Figure 2.9. All bundles in the positive quadrant which are on or below the line are included in the budget set. The equation of the line is Budget Set. Quantity of bananas is measured p x  + p x  = M (2.2) along the horizontal axis and quantity of mangoes 1 1 2 2 is measured along the vertical axis. Any point in The line consists of all bundles which the diagram represents a bundle of the two cost exactly equal to M. This line is goods. The budget set consists of all points on called the budget line. Points below or below the straight line having the equation the budget line represent bundles p x  + p x  = M. 1 1 2 2 which cost strictly less than M. The equation (2.2) can also be written as7 M p x = − 1 2 x (2.3) p p 1 2 2 M The budget line is a straight line with horizontal intercept p  and vertical 1 M intercept p . The horizontal intercept represents the bundle that the consumer 2 can buy if she spends her entire income on bananas. Similarly, the vertical intercept represents the bundle that the consumer can buy if she spends her p entire income on mangoes. The slope of the budget line is – 1 p . 16 2 Price Ratio and the Slope of the Budget Line Think of any point on the budget line. Such a point represents a bundle which costs the consumer her entire budget. Now suppose the consumer wants to have one more banana. She can do it only if she gives up some amount of the other good. How many mangoes does she have to give up if she wants to have an extra quantity of bananas? It would depend on the prices of the two goods. A quantity of banana costs p . Therefore, she will have to reduce her expenditure 1 on mangoes by p  amount, if she wants one more quantity of banana. With p , 1 1 p1 she could buy p  quantities of mangoes. Therefore, if the consumer wants to 2 have an extra quantity of bananas when she is spending all her money, she will p1 have to give up p quantities of mangoes. In other words, in the given market 2 6The goods considered in Example 2.1 were not divisible and were available only in integer units. There are many goods which are divisible in the sense that they are available in non-integer units also. It is not possible to buy half an orange or one-fourth of a banana, but it is certainly possible to buy half a kilogram of rice or one-fourth of a litre of milk. 7In school mathematics, you have learnt the equation of a straight line as y = c + mx where c is the vertical intercept and m is the  slope of the straight line. Note that equation (2.3) has the same form. Reprint 2024-25 Introductory Microeconomics Derivation of the Slope of the Budget Line Mangoes The slope of the budget line measures the amount of change in mangoes required per unit of change in bananas along the budget line. Consider any two points (x , x ) and (x  + ∆x , x  + ∆x ) 1 2 1 1 2 2 on the budget line.a Bananas It must be the case that p x  + p x  = M (2.4) 1 1 2 2 and, p (x  + ∆x ) + p (x  + ∆x ) = M          (2.5) 1 1 1 2 2 2 Subtracting (2.4) from (2.5), we obtain p ∆x  + p ∆x  = 0 (2.6) 1 1 2 2 By rearranging terms in (2.6), we obtain ∆x2 p = − 1 ∆ (2.7) x1 p2 a∆ (delta) is a Greek letter. In mathematics, ∆ is sometimes used to denote ‘a change’. Thus, ∆x  stands for a change in x  and ∆x  stands for a change in x . 1 1 2 2 p1 conditions, the consumer can substitute bananas for mangoes at the rate p . 2 The absolute value8 of the slope of the budget line measures the rate at which the consumer is able to substitute bananas for mangoes when she spends her 17 entire budget. 2.2.2 Changes in the Budget Set The set of available bundles depends on the prices of the two goods and the income of the consumer. When the price of either of the goods or the consumer’s income changes, the set of available bundles is also likely to change. Suppose the consumer’s income changes from M to M ′ but the prices of the two goods remain unchanged. With the new income, the consumer can afford to buy all bundles (x , x ) such that p x  + p x  ≤ M ′. Now the equation of the budget line is 1 2 1 1 2 2 p x  + p x  = M ′ (2.8) 1 1 2 2 Equation (2.8) can also be written as M' p x = – 1 2 x p p 1 (2.9) 2 2 Note that the slope of the new budget line is the same as the slope of the budget line prior to the change in the consumer’s income. However, the vertical intercept has changed after the change in income. If there is an increase in the 8The absolute value of a number x is equal to x if x ≥ 0 and is equal to – x if x < 0. The absolute value of x is usually denoted by |x|. Reprint 2024-25 Theory of Consumer Behaviour income, i.e. if M' > M, the vertical as well as horizontal intercepts increase, there is a parallel outward shift of the budget line. If the income increases, the consumer can buy more of the goods at the prevailing market prices. Similarly, if the income goes down, i.e. if M' < M, both intercepts decrease, and hence, there is a parallel inward shift of the budget line. If income goes down, the availability of goods goes down. Changes in the set of available bundles resulting from changes in consumer’s income when the prices of the two goods remain unchanged are shown in Figure 2.10. Mangoes Mangoes M'<M M'>M Bananas Bananas 10 Changes in the Set of Available Bundles of Goods Resulting from Changes in the Consumer’s Income. A decrease in income causes a parallel inward shift of the budget line as in panel (a). An increase in income causes a parallel outward shift of the budget line as in panel (b). Now suppose the price of bananas change from p  to p'  but the price of 1 1 mangoes and the consumer’s income remain unchanged. At the new price of bananas, the consumer can afford to buy all bundles (x ,x ) such that p' x  + 1 2 1 1 p x  ≤ M. The equation of the budget line is 18 2 2 p' x  + p x  = M (2.10) 1 1 2 2 Equation (2.10) can also be written as M p' x 1 2 = – x p p 1 (2.11) 2 2 Note that the vertical intercept of the new budget line is the same as the vertical intercept of the budget line prior to the change in the price of bananas. However, the slope of the budget line and horizontal intercept have changed after the price change. If the price of bananas increases, ie if p' > p , the absolute 1 1 value of the slope of the budget line increases, and the budget line becomes steeper (it pivots inwards around the vertical intercept and horizontal intercept decreases). If the price of bananas decreases, i.e., p' < p , the absolute value of 1 1 the slope of the budget line decreases and hence, the budget line becomes flatter (it pivots outwards around the vertical intercept and horizontal intercept increases). Figure 2.11 shows change in the budget set when the price of only one commodity changes while the price of the other commodity as well as income of the consumer are constant. A change in price of mangoes, when price of bananas and the consumer’s income remain unchanged, will bring about similar changes in the budget set of the consumer.

A decrease in the price of bananas makes the budget line flatter as in panel (b). 2.3 OPTIMAL CHOICE OF THE CONSUMER The budget set consists of all bundles that are available to the consumer. The consumer can choose her consumption bundle from the budget set. But on what basis does she choose her consumption bundle from the ones that are available to her? In economics, it is assumed that the consumer chooses her consumption bundle on the basis of her  tatse and preferences over  the bundles in the budget set. It is generally assumed that the consumer has well defined preferences over the set of all possible bundles. She can compare any two bundles. In other words, between any two bundles, she either prefers one to the other or she is indifferent between the two. Equality of the Marginal Rate of Substitution and the Ratio of 19 the Prices The optimum bundle of the consumer is located at the point where the budget line is tangent to one of the indifference curves. If the budget line is tangent to an indifference curve at a point, the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve (MRS) and that of the budget line (price ratio) are same at that point. Recall from our earlier discussion that the slope of the indifference curve is the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute one good for the other. The slope of the budget line is the rate at which the consumer is able to substitute one good for the other in the market. At the optimum, the two rates should be the same. To see why, consider a point where this is not so. Suppose the MRS at such a point is 2 and suppose the two goods have the same price. At this point, the consumer is willing to give up 2 mangoes if she is given an extra banana. But in the market, she can buy an extra banana if she gives up just 1 mango. Therefore, if she buys an extra banana, she can have more of both the goods compared to the bundle represented by the point, and hence, move to a preferred bundle. Thus, a point at which the MRS is greater, the price ratio cannot be the optimum. A similar argument holds for any point at which the MRS is less than the price ratio. Reprint 2024-25 Theory of Consumer Behaviour In economics, it is generally assumed that the consumer is a rational individual. A rational individual clearly knows what is good or what is bad for her, and in any given situation, she always tries to achieve the best for herself. Thus, not only does a consumer have well-defined preferences over the set of available bundles, she also acts according to her preferences. From the bundles which are available to her, a rational consumer always chooses the one which gives her maximum satisfaction. In the earlier sections, it was observed that the budget set describes the bundles that are available to the consumer and her preferences over the available bundles can usually be represented by an indifference map. Therefore, the consumer’s problem can also be stated as follows: The rational consumer’s problem is to move to a point on the highest possible indifference curve given her budget set. If such a point exists, where would it be located? The optimum point would be located on the budget line. A point below the budget line cannot be the optimum. Compared to a point below the budget line, there is always some point on the budget line which contains more of at least one of the goods and no less of the other, and is, therefore, preferred by a consumer whose preferences are monotonic. Therefore, if the consumer’s preferences are monotonic, for any point below the budget line, there is some point on the budget line which is preferred by the consumer. Points above the budget line are not available to the consumer. Therefore, the optimum (most preferred) bundle of the consumer would be on the budget line. Where on the budget line will the optimum bundle be located? The point at which the budget line just touches (is tangent to), one of the indifference curves would be the optimum.9 To see why this is so, note that any point on the budget line other than the point at which it touches the indifference curve lies on a lower indifference curve and hence is inferior. Therefore, such a point cannot be the consumer’s optimum. The optimum bundle is located on the budget line at 20 the point where the budget line is tangent to an indifference curve. Figure 2.12 illustrates the consumer’s optimum. At (x *, x * 1 2 ) , the budget line is tangent to the black coloured indifference curve. The first thing to note is that the indifference curve just touching the budget line is the highest possible indifference curve given the consumer’s budget set. Bundles on the indifference curves above this, like the grey one, are not affordable. Points on the indifference curves below this, like the Consumer’s Optimum. The point (x ∗, x ∗ ), at 1 2 blue one, are certainly inferior to the which the budget line is tangent to an indifference curve represents the consumers points on the indifference curve, just touching the budget line. Any other point on the budget line lies on a lower indifference curve and hence, is inferior to (x *, x * ) . Therefore, (x *, * 1 x2 )  is the consumer’s optimum bundle. 1 2 9 To be more precise, if the situation is as depicted in Figure 2.12 then the optimum would be located at the point where the budget line is tangent to one of the indifference curves. However, there are other situations in which the optimum is at a point where the consumer spends her entire income on one of the goods only. Reprint 2024-25 Introductory Microeconomics 2.4 DEMAND In the previous section, we studied the choice problem of the consumer and derived the consumer’s optimum bundle given the prices of the goods, the consumer’s income and her preferences. It was observed that the amount of a good that the consumer chooses optimally, depends on the price of the good itself, the prices of other goods, the consumer’s income and her tastes and preferences. The quantity of a commodity that a consumer is willing to buy and
