Chapter 6 APPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES v With the Calculus as a key, Mathematics can be successfully applied to the explanation of the course of Nature.” — WHITEHEAD v 6.1 Introduction In Chapter 5, we have learnt how to find derivative of composite functions, inverse trigonometric functions, implicit functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions. In this chapter, we will study applications of the derivative in various disciplines, e.g., in engineering, science, social science, and many  other fields. For instance, we will learn how the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities, (ii) to find the equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (iii) to find turning points on the graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or smallest value (locally) of a function occurs. We will also use derivative to find intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing. Finally, we use the derivative to find approximate value of certain quantities. 6.2 Rate of Change of Quantities ds Recall that by the derivative , we mean the rate of change of distance s with dt respect to the time t. In a similar fashion, whenever one quantity y varies with another dy quantity x, satisfying some rule y = f (x) , then  (or f ′(x)) represents the rate of dx dy  change of y with respect to x and  dx   (or f ′(x )) represents the  rate of change x= 0 x0 of y with respect to x at x = x0 . Further, if two variables x and y are varying with respect to another variable t, i.e., if x = f (t) and y = g(t) , then by Chain Rule dy dy dx dx = ,  if  ≠ 0 dx dt dt dt Reprint 2024-25 148  MATHEMATICS Thus, the rate of change of y with respect to x can be calculated using the rate of change of y and that of x both with respect to t. Let us consider some examples. Example 1 Find the rate of change of the area of a circle per second with respect to its radius r when r = 5 cm. Solution The area A of a circle with radius r is given by A = πr2. Therefore, the rate dA d of change of the area A with respect to its radius r is given by = (πr2 ) = 2πr . dr dr dA When r = 5 cm, =10π . Thus, the area of the circle is changing at the rate of dr 10π cm2/s. Example 2 The volume of a cube is increasing at a rate of 9 cubic centimetres per second. How fast is the surface area increasing when the length of an edge is 10 centimetres ? Solution Let x be the length of a side, V be the volume and S be the surface area of the cube. Then, V = x3 and S = 6x2, where x is a function of time t. dV Now  = 9cm3/s (Given) dt dV d = 3 d 3 dx Therefore 9 = (x ) = (x ) ⋅ (By Chain Rule) dt dt dx dt dx = 3x2 ⋅ dt dx 3 or  = 2 ...

At the instant, when the radius of the circular wave is 10 cm, how fast is the enclosed area increasing? Solution The area A of a circle with radius r is given by A = πr2. Therefore, the rate of change of area A with respect to time t is dA d 2 d 2 dr dr = (πr ) = (πr ) ⋅  = 2π r (By Chain Rule) dt dt dr dt dt dr It is given that  = 4cm/s dt dA Therefore, when r = 10 cm,  = 2π (10) (4) = 80π dt Thus, the enclosed area is increasing at the rate of 80π cm2/s, when r = 10 cm. dy ANote   is positive if y increases as x increases and is negative if y decreases dx as x increases. Example 4 The length x of a rectangle is decreasing at the rate of 3 cm/minute and the width y is increasing at the rate of 2cm/minute. When x =10cm and y = 6cm, find the rates of change of (a) the perimeter and (b) the area of the rectangle. Solution Since the length x is decreasing and the width y is increasing with respect to time, we have dx dy = −3 cm/min and = 2 cm/min dt dt (a) The perimeter P of a rectangle is given by P = 2 (x + y) dP  dx dy  Therefore  = 2 + 2 (−3 2 = 2 i dt  c / dt d  = + ) − m m n t (b) The area A of the rectangle is given by A = x . y dA dx dy Therefore  = ⋅ y + x ⋅ dt dt dt = – 3(6) + 10(2) (as x = 10 cm and y = 6 cm) = 2 cm2/min Reprint 2024-25 150  MATHEMATICS Example 5 The total cost C(x) in Rupees, associated with the production of x units of an item is given by C(x) = 0.005 x3 – 0.02 x2 + 30x + 5000 Find the marginal cost when 3 units are produced, where by marginal cost we mean the instantaneous rate of change of total cost at any level of output. Solution Since marginal cost is the rate of change of total cost with respect to the output, we have dC = 0.005(3x2 Marginal cost (MC) = ) − 0.02(2x) + 30 dx 2 When x = 3, MC = 0.015(3 ) − 0.04(3) + 30 = 0.135 – 0.12 + 30 = 30.015 Hence, the required marginal cost is ` 30.02 (nearly). Example 6 The total revenue in Rupees received from the sale of x units of a product is given by R(x) = 3x2 + 36x + 5. Find the marginal revenue, when x = 5, where by marginal revenue we mean the rate of change of total revenue with respect to the number of items sold at an instant. Solution Since marginal revenue is the rate of change of total revenue with respect to the number of units sold, we have dR Marginal Revenue (MR) = = 6x + 36 dx When x = 5, MR = 6(5) + 36 = 66 Hence, the required marginal revenue is ` 66.

Consider the function f given by f (x) = x2, x ∈ R. The graph of this function is a parabola  as given in Fig 6.1. Values left to origin Values right to origin x f (x) = x2 x f (x) = x2 –2 4 0 0 − 3 9 1 1 2 4 2 4 –1 1  1 1 − 1 1 3 9 2 4 2 4 0 0  2 4 as we move from left to right, the as we move from left to right, the height of the graph decreases height of the graph increases Fig 6.1 First consider the graph (Fig 6.1) to the right of the origin. Observe that as we move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously increases. For this reason, the function is said to be increasing for the real numbers x > 0. Now consider the graph to the left of the origin and observe here that as we move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously decreases. Consequently, the function is said to be decreasing for the real numbers  x < 0. We shall now give the following analytical definitions for a function which is increasing or decreasing on an interval. Definition 1 Let I be an interval contained in the domain of a real valued function f. Then f is said to be (i) increasing on I if x  < x  in I ⇒ f (x ) < f (x ) for all x , x  ∈ I. 1 2 1 2 1 2 (ii) decreasing on I, if x , x  in I ⇒ f (x ) < f (x ) for all x , x  ∈ I. 1 2 1 2 1 2 (iii) constant on I, if f(x) = c for all x ∈ I, where c is a constant. Reprint 2024-25 APPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 153 (iv) decreasing on I if x  < x  in I ⇒ f (x ) ≥ f (x ) for all x , x  ∈ I. 1 2 1 2 1 2 (v) strictly decreasing on I if x  < x  in I ⇒ f (x ) > f (x ) for all x , x  ∈ I. 1 2 1 2 1 2 For graphical representation of such functions see Fig 6.2. Strictly Increasing function Strictly Decreasing function Neither Increasing nor (i) (ii) Decreasing function (iii) Fig 6.2 We shall now define when a function is increasing or decreasing at a point. Definition 2 Let x  be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function  f. 0 Then  f  is said to be increasing, decreasing at x  if  there exists an open interval I 0 containing x  such that f is increasing, decreasing, respectively, in I. 0 Let us clarify this definition for the case of increasing function. Example 7 Show that the function given by f (x) = 7x – 3 is increasing on R. Solution Let x  and x  be any two numbers in R. Then 1 2 x  < x  ⇒ 7x  < 7x  ⇒ 7x  – 3 < 7x  – 3 ⇒ f (x ) < f (x ) 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 Thus, by Definition 1, it follows that f is strictly increasing on R. We shall now give the first derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions. The proof of this test requires the Mean Value Theorem studied in Chapter 5. Theorem 1 Let  f  be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a,b). Then (a) f  is increasing in [a,b] if f ′(x) > 0 for each x ∈ (a, b) (b) f  is decreasing in [a,b] if f ′(x) < 0 for each x ∈ (a, b) (c) f  is a constant function in [a,b] if f ′(x) = 0 for each x ∈ (a, b) Reprint 2024-25 154  MATHEMATICS Proof (a) Let x , x  ∈ [a, b] be such that x  < x . 1 2 1 2 Then, by Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 8 in Chapter 5), there exists a point c between x  and x  such that 1 2 f (x ) – f (x ) = f ′(c) (x  – x ) 2 1 2 1 i.e. f (x ) – f (x ) > 0 (as f ′(c) > 0 (given)) 2 1 i.e. f (x ) > f (x ) 2 1 Thus, we have x1 < x2  f (x1)  f (x2 ), for all x1, x2  [a,b] Hence, f  is an increasing function in [a,b]. The proofs of part (b) and (c) are similar. It is left as an exercise to the reader. Remarks There is a more generalised theorem, which states that if f¢(x) > 0 for x in an interval excluding the end points and f is continuous in the interval, then f is increasing. Similarly, if f¢(x) < 0 for x in an interval excluding the end points and f is continuous in the interval, then f is decreasing. Example 8 Show that the function  f  given by f (x) = x3 – 3x2 + 4x, x ∈ R is increasing on R. Solution Note that f ′(x) = 3x2 – 6x + 4 = 3(x2 – 2x + 1) + 1 = 3(x – 1)2 + 1 > 0, in every interval of R Therefore, the function  f is increasing on R. Example 9 Prove that the function given by f (x) = cos x is (a) decreasing in (0, π) (b) increasing in (π, 2π), and (c) neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2π). Reprint 2024-25 APPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 155 Solution Note that f ′(x) = – sin x (a) Since for each x ∈ (0, π), sin x > 0, we have f ′(x) < 0 and so f is decreasing in (0, π). (b) Since for each x ∈ (π, 2π), sin x < 0, we have f ′(x) > 0 and so f is increasing in (π, 2π). (c) Clearly by (a) and (b) above, f is neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2π). Example 10 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = x2 – 4x + 6 is (a) increasing (b)  decreasing Solution We have f (x) = x2 – 4x + 6 Fig 6.3 or f ′(x) = 2x – 4 Therefore, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 2. Now the point x = 2 divides the real line into two disjoint intervals namely, (– ∞, 2) and (2, ∞) (Fig 6.3). In the interval (– ∞, 2), f ′(x) = 2x – 4 < 0. Therefore, f is decreasing in this interval. Also, in the interval (2,∞) , f ′(x) > 0 and so the function  f  is increasing in this interval. Example 11 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72x + 30 is (a) increasing (b) decreasing. Solution We have f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72x + 30 or f ′(x) = 12x2 – 12x – 72 = 12(x2 – x – 6) = 12(x – 3) (x + 2) Therefore, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = – 2, 3. The points x = – 2 and  x = 3 divides the real line into three disjoint intervals, namely, (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 3) Fig 6.4 and (3, ∞). Reprint 2024-25 156  MATHEMATICS In the intervals (– ∞, – 2) and (3, ∞), f ′(x) is positive while in the interval (– 2, 3), f ′(x) is negative. Consequently, the function f is increasing in the intervals (– ∞, – 2) and (3, ∞) while the function is decreasing in the interval (– 2, 3). However, f is neither increasing nor decreasing in R.

In fact, we will find the ‘turning points’ of the graph of a function and thus find points at which the graph reaches its highest (or Reprint 2024-25 160  MATHEMATICS lowest) locally. The knowledge of such points is very useful in sketching the graph of a given function. Further, we will also find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function that are necessary for the solution of many applied problems. Let us consider the following problems that arise in day to day life. (i) The profit from a grove of orange trees is given by P(x) = ax + bx2, where a,b are constants and x is the number of orange trees per acre. How many trees per acre will maximise the profit? (ii) A ball, thrown into the air from a building 60 metres high, travels along a path x2 given by h(x) = 60 + x − , where x is the horizontal distance from the building 60 and h(x) is the height of the ball . What is the maximum height the ball will reach? (iii) An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve f (x) = x2 + 7. A soldier, placed at the point (1, 2), wants to shoot the helicopter when it is nearest to him. What is the nearest distance? In each of the above problem, there is something common, i.e., we wish to find out the maximum or minimum values of the given functions. In order to tackle such problems, we first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local maxima and minima and test for determining such points. Definition 3 Let f be a function defined on an interval I. Then (a)  f is said to have a maximum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that f (c) > f (x) , for all x ∈ I. The number f (c) is called the maximum value of f in I and the point c is called a point of maximum value of f in I. (b)  f  is said to have a minimum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that f (c) < f (x), for all x ∈ I. The number f (c), in this case, is called the minimum value of f in I and the point c, in this case, is called a point of minimum value of  f  in I. (c) f is said to have an extreme value in I if there exists a point c in I such that f (c) is either a maximum value or a minimum value of f  in I. The number  f (c), in this case, is called an extreme value of  f  in I and the point c is called an extreme point. Remark In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular functions  help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point. Infact, through graphs, we can even find maximum/minimum value of a function at a point at which it is not even differentiable (Example 15). Reprint 2024-25 APPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 161 Fig 6.7 Example 14 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function f  given by f (x) = x2, x ∈ R. Solution From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.8), we have  f (x) = 0 if x = 0. Also f (x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R. Therefore, the minimum value of  f  is 0 and the point of minimum value of f is x = 0. Further, it may be observed from the graph of the function that f  has no maximum value and hence no point of maximum value of  f  in R. Fig 6.8 ANote  If we restrict the domain of  f to [– 2, 1] only, then f will have maximum value(– 2)2 = 4 at x = – 2. Example 15 Find the maximum and minimum values of  f , if any, of the function given by f (x) = |x |, x ∈ R. Solution From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.9) , note that f (x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and  f (x) = 0  if  x = 0. Therefore, the function f has a minimum value 0 and the point of minimum value of f is x = 0. Also, the graph clearly shows that f has no maximum value in R and hence no point of maximum value in R. Fig 6.9 ANote (i) If we restrict the domain of f to [– 2, 1] only, then f will have maximum value | – 2| = 2. Reprint 2024-25 162  MATHEMATICS (ii) One may note that the function f in Example 27 is not differentiable at x = 0. Example 16 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function given by f (x) = x, x ∈ (0, 1). Solution The given function is an increasing (strictly) function in the given interval (0, 1). From the graph (Fig 6.10) of the function f , it seems that, it should have the minimum value at a point closest to 0 on its right and the maximum value at a point closest to 1 on its left. Are such points available? Of course, not. It is not possible to locate such points. Infact, if a point x  is closest to 0, then 0 x0 we find < x0  for all x ( 2 0 ∈ 0,1) . Also, if x  is closest 1 x1 +1 to 1, then > x1  for all x1 ∈(0,1) . 2 Fig 6.10
