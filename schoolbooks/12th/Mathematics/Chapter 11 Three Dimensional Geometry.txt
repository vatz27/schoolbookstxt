THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY 377 Chapter 11 THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY v The moving power of mathematical invention is not reasoning but imagination. – A.DEMORGAN v 11.1  Introduction In Class XI, while studying Analytical Geometry in two dimensions, and the introduction to three dimensional geometry, we confined to the Cartesian methods only. In the previous chapter of this book, we have studied some basic concepts of vectors. We will now use vector algebra to three dimensional geometry. The purpose of this approach to 3-dimensional geometry is that it makes the study simple and elegant*. In this chapter, we shall study the direction cosines and direction ratios of a line joining two points and also discuss about the equations of lines and planes in space under different conditions, angle between two lines, two Leonhard Euler planes, a line and a plane, shortest distance between two (1707-1783) skew lines and distance of a point from a plane. Most of the above results are obtained in vector form. Nevertheless, we shall also translate these results in the Cartesian form which, at times, presents a more clear geometric and analytic picture of the situation. 11.2  Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios of a Line From Chapter 10, recall that if a directed line L passing through the origin makes angles α, β and γ with x, y and z-axes, respectively, called direction angles, then cosine of these angles, namely, cos α, cos β and cos γ are called direction cosines of the directed line L. If we reverse the direction of L, then the direction angles are replaced by their supplements, i.e., ,  and . Thus, the signs of the direction cosines are reversed. * For various activities in three dimensional geometry, one may refer to the Book “A Hand Book for designing Mathematics Laboratory in Schools”, NCERT, 2005 Reprint 2024-25 378  MATHEMATICS Fig 11.1 Note that a given line in space can be extended in two opposite directions and so it has two sets of direction cosines. In order to have a unique set of direction cosines for a given line in space, we must take the given line as a directed line. These unique direction cosines are denoted by l, m and n. Remark If the given line in space does not pass through the origin, then, in order to find its direction cosines, we draw a line through the origin and parallel to the given line. Now take one of the directed lines from the origin and find its direction cosines as two parallel line have same set of direction cosines. Any three numbers which are proportional to the direction cosines of a line are called the direction ratios of the line. If l, m, n are direction cosines and a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then a = λl, b=λm and c = λn, for any nonzero λ ∈ R. ANote   Some authors also call direction ratios as direction numbers. Let a, b, c be direction ratios of a line and let l, m and n be the direction cosines (d.c’s) of the line. Then l m n =  = = k  (say), k being a constant. a b c Therefore l = ak, m = bk, n = ck ... (1) But l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 Therefore k2 (a2 + b2 + c2) = 1 1 or k = ± 2 a + 2 b + 2 c Reprint 2024-25 THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY 379 Hence, from (1), the d.c.’s of the line are a b c l = ± ,m= ± ,n = ± 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 a +b + c a +b +c a +b +c where, depending on the desired sign of k, either a positive or a negative sign is to be taken for l, m and n. For any line, if a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then ka, kb, kc; k ≠ 0 is also a set of direction ratios. So, any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional. Also, for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios. 11.2.1  Direction cosines of a line passing through two points Since one and only one line passes through two given points, we can determine the direction cosines of a line passing through the given points P(x , y , z ) and Q(x , y , z ) 1 1 1 2 2 2 as follows (Fig 11.2 (a)). Fig 11.2 Let l, m, n be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles α, β and  γ with the x, y and z-axis, respectively. Draw perpendiculars from P and Q to XY-plane to meet at R and S. Draw a perpendicular from P to QS to meet at N. Now, in right angle triangle PNQ, ∠PQN= γ (Fig 11.2 (b). NQ z2 − z = 1 Therefore, cos γ = PQ PQ x Similarly cosα = 2 − x1 y − y and cosβ= 2 1 PQ PQ Hence, the direction cosines of the line segment joining the points P(x , y , z ) and 1 1 1 Q(x , y , z ) are 2 2 2 Reprint 2024-25 380  MATHEMATICS x2 − x y − y z 1 2 − z1 , 2 1 , PQ PQ PQ 2 where PQ = 2 2 (x2 − x1) + (y2 − y1) + (z2 − z1) ANote   The direction ratios of the line segment joining P(x , y , z ) and Q(x , y , z ) 1 1 1 2 2 2 may be taken as x – x , y – y , z – z  or x – x , y – y , z – z 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 Example 1 If a line makes angle 90°, 60° and 30° with the positive direction of x, y and z-axis respectively, find its direction cosines. 1 Solution Let the d .c .

Solution We know the direction cosines of the line passing through  two points P(x , y , z ) and Q(x , y , z ) are given by 1 1 1 2 2 2 x2 − x1 y , 2 − y1 z , 2 − z1 PQ PQ PQ where PQ = 2 2 (x2 ( )2 − x1) + (y2 − y1) + z2 − z1 Here P is (– 2, 4, – 5) and Q is (1, 2, 3). So PQ = − 2 2 2 (1 (−2)) + (2 − 4) + (3− (−5))  = 77 Thus, the direction cosines of the line joining two points is 3 −2 8 , , 77 77 77 Reprint 2024-25 THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY 381 Example 4 Find the direction cosines of x, y and z-axis. Solution The x-axis makes angles 0°, 90° and 90° respectively with x, y and z-axis. Therefore, the direction cosines of x-axis are cos 0°, cos 90°, cos 90° i.e., 1,0,0. Similarly, direction cosines of y-axis and z-axis are 0, 1, 0 and 0, 0, 1 respectively. Example 5 Show that the points A (2, 3, – 4), B (1, – 2, 3) and C (3, 8, – 11) are collinear. Solution Direction ratios of line joining A and B are 1 – 2, – 2 – 3, 3 + 4 i.e., – 1, – 5, 7. The direction ratios of line joining B and C are 3 –1, 8 + 2, – 11 – 3, i.e., 2, 10, – 14. It is clear that direction ratios of AB and BC are proportional, hence, AB is parallel to BC. But point B is common to both AB and BC. Therefore, A, B, C are collinear points. EXERCISE 11.1 1.

Find the direction cosines of the sides of the triangle whose vertices are (3, 5, – 4), (– 1, 1, 2) and (– 5, – 5, – 2). 11.3 Equation of a Line in Space We have studied equation of  lines in two dimensions in Class XI, we shall now study the vector and cartesian equations of a line in space. A line is uniquely determined if (i) it passes through a given point and has given direction, or (ii) it passes through two given points. 11.3.1 Equation of a line through a given point and parallel to  given vector Let  be the position vector of the given point A with respect to the origin O of the rectangular coordinate system. Let l be the line which passes through the point A and is parallel to a given vector . Let   be the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the line (Fig 11.3).

Hence, the vector equation of the line is given by Fig 11.3 r r = a + » b ... (1) r Remark If b = aiˆ + bˆj kˆ+ c , then a, b, c are direction ratios of the line and conversely, r if a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then b = aiˆ ˆ + bˆj + ck  will be the parallel to the line. Here, b should not be confused with | |. Derivation of cartesian form from vector form Let the coordinates of the given point A be (x , y , z ) and the direction  ratios of 1 1 1 the line be a, b, c. Consider the coordinates of any point P be (x, y, z). Then r ˆ ˆ r r = xi + yj ˆ + zk; a x ˆi ˆ ˆ = 1 + y1 j + z1 k r and b = a iˆ + b ˆj ˆ + c k Substituting these values in (1) and equating the coefficients of iˆ, ˆj  and k̂ , we get x = x  + λ a;  y = y  + λ b;  z = z + λ c ...

Solution We have r = 5iˆ+ 2 ˆj −4kˆ and b =3iˆ+ 2 ˆj −8kˆ Reprint 2024-25 THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY 383 Therefore, the vector equation of the line is = 5 iˆ + 2 ˆj − 4 kˆ + λ ( 3 iˆ + 2 ˆj − 8 kˆ) Now,  is the position vector of any point P(x, y, z) on the line. Therefore, xiˆ + y ˆj + z kˆ  = 5iˆ + 2 ˆj − 4kˆ + λ ( 3 iˆ + 2 ˆj − 8 kˆ) = (5+ 3λ) iˆ+ (2 + 2λ) ˆj + (−4 − 8λ) kˆ Eliminating λ , we get x−5 y −2 z +4 = = 3 2 −8 which is the equation of the line in Cartesian form. 11.4  Angle between Two Lines Let L  and L  be two lines passing through the origin 1 2 and with direction ratios a , b , c  and a , b , c , 1 1 1 2 2 2 respectively. Let P be a point on L  and Q be a point 1 on L . Consider the directed lines OP and OQ as 2 given in Fig 11.6. Let θ be the acute angle between OP and OQ. Now recall that the directed line segments OP and OQ are vectors with components a , b , c  and a , b , c , respectively.

If instead of direction ratios for the lines L  and L , direction cosines, namely, 1 2 l , m , n  for L  and l , m , n  for L  are given, then (1) and (2) takes the following form: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 cos θ = | l l  + m m  + n n |    (as 1 2 1 2 1 2 l2 + m2 2 1 1 + n1 =1 = l2 + m2 n2 ) ...

Also, if two lines in space are parallel, then the shortest distance between them will be the perpendicular distance, i.e. the length of the perpendicular drawn from a point on one line onto the other line. Further, in a space, there are lines which are neither intersecting nor parallel. In fact, such pair of lines are non coplanar and are called skew lines. For example, let us consider a room of size 1, 3, 2 units along Fig 11.5 x, y and z-axes respectively Fig 11.5. Reprint 2024-25 386  MATHEMATICS The line GE that goes diagonally across the ceiling and the line DB passes through one corner of the ceiling directly above A and goes diagonally down the wall. These lines are skew because they are not parallel and also never meet. By the shortest distance between two lines we mean the join of a point in one line with one point on the other line so that the length of the segment so obtained is the smallest. For skew lines, the line of the shortest distance will be perpendicular to both the lines. 11.5.1  Distance between two skew lines We now determine the shortest distance between two skew lines in the following way: Let l and l be two skew lines with equations (Fig. 11.6) 1 2 r r = a1 + λ b1     ...
