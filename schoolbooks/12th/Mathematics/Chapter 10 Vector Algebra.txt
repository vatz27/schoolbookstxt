338  MATHEMATICS Chapter 10 VECTOR ALGEBRA v In most sciences one generation tears down what another has built and what one has established another undoes. In Mathematics alone each generation builds a new story to the old structure. – HERMAN HANKEL v 10.1  Introduction In our day to day life, we come across many queries such as – What is your height? How should a football player hit the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters, a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which is a real number. Such quantities are called scalars. However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and direction (in which another player is positioned). Such quantities are called vectors. In mathematics, physics and engineering, we frequently come across with both types of W.R. Hamilton quantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length, mass, (1805-1865) time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work, money, voltage, density, resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration,  force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc. In this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors, and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above. 10.2  Some Basic Concepts Let ‘l’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given two directions by means of arrowheads. A line with one of these directions prescribed is called a directed line (Fig 10.1 (i), (ii)). Reprint 2024-25 VECTOR ALGEBRA 339 Fig 10.1 Now observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude is prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed line segment (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as direction. Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector. Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as  or simply as , and read as ‘vector ’ or ‘vector ’. The point A from where the vector  starts is called its initial point, and the point B where it ends is called its terminal point. The distance between initial and terminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as | |, or | |, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector. ANote   Since the length is never negative, the notation | | < 0 has no meaning. Position Vector From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system (Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P in space, having coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to the origin O(0, 0, 0). Then, the vector  having O and P as its initial and terminal points, respectively, is called the position vector of the point P with respect to O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of  (or ) is given by | |= 2 2 2 x + y + z In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O are denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)). Reprint 2024-25 340  MATHEMATICS Fig 10.2 Direction Cosines Consider the position vector  of a point P(x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles α, β, γ made by the vector  with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively, are called its direction angles. The cosine values of these angles, i.e., cos α, cosβ and cos γ are called direction cosines of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n, respectively. Z C z P(x,y,z) r g b y O a Y B P x A O a 90° X A Fig 10.3 X From  Fig 10.3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we have . Similarly, from the right angled triangles OBP and y z OCP, we may write cos β =  and cos γ = . Thus, the coordinates of the point P may r r also be expressed as (lr, mr,nr).  The numbers lr, mr and nr, proportional to the direction cosines are called as direction ratios of vector , and denoted as a, b and c, respectively. Reprint 2024-25 VECTOR ALGEBRA 341 ANote   One may note that l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 but a2 + b2 + c2 ≠ 1, in general. 10.3  Types of Vectors Zero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector (or null vector), and denoted as . Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction as it has zero magnitude. Or, alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any direction. The vectors  represent the zero vector, Unit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector. The unit vector in the direction of a given vector  is denoted by â . Coinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial vectors. Collinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions. Equal Vectors Two vectors  are said to be equal, if they have the same magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written as . Negative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector (say, ), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector. For example, vector  is negative of the vector , and written as  = – . Remark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are called free vectors. Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only. Example 1 Represent graphically a displacement of 40 km, 30° west of south. Solution The vector  represents the required displacement (Fig 10.4). Example 2 Classify the following measures as scalars and vectors.

Now consider a situation that a girl moves from A to B and then from B to C (Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from point A to the point C, is given by the vector  and expressed as Fig 10.7 = This is known as the triangle law of vector addition. In general, if we have two vectors  and  (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other (Fig 10.8(ii)). C C b + b a b b a A B A B a a –b a – b (i) (ii) (iii) C’ Fig 10.8 For example, in Fig 10.8 (ii), we have shifted vector  without changing its magnitude and direction, so that it’s initial point coincides with the terminal point of . Then, the vector  + , represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or resultant) of the vectors  and  i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have = Now again, since , from the above equation, we have This means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order, it leads to zero resultant as the initial and terminal points get coincided (Fig 10.8(iii)). Reprint 2024-25 344  MATHEMATICS Now, construct a vector  so that its magnitude is same as the vector , but the direction opposite to that of it (Fig 10.8 (iii)), i.e., = Then, on applying triangle law from the Fig 10.8 (iii), we have = The vector  is said to represent the difference of . Now, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a direction perpendicular to the flow of the river. Then, it is acted upon by two velocity vectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the velocity of the flow of river water. Under the simultaneous influence of these two velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity. To have a precise idea about the effective speed and direction (i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have the following law of vector addition. If we have two vectors  represented by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their sum  is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram through their common point. This is known as Fig 10.9 the parallelogram law of vector addition. ANote   F rom Fig 10.9, using the triangle law, one may note that = or  =                                   (since  ) which is parallelogram law. Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector addition are equivalent to each other. Properties of vector addition Property 1 For any two vectors , = (Commutative property) Reprint 2024-25 VECTOR ALGEBRA 345 Proof Consider the parallelogram ABCD (Fig 10.10). Let  then using the triangle law, from triangle ABC, we have Now, since the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel, from Fig 10.10, we have,  and Fig 10.10 . Again using triangle law, from triangle ADC, we have Hence  = Property 2 For any three vectors a, b and c = (Associative property) Proof Let the vectors  be represented by , respectively, as shown in Fig 10.11(i) and (ii). Fig 10.11 Then  = and  = So  = Reprint 2024-25 346  MATHEMATICS and  = Hence  = Remark The associative property of vector addition enables us to write the sum of three vectors  without using brackets. Note that for any vector a , we have = Here, the zero vector  is called the additive identity for the vector addition. 10.5  Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar Let  be a given vector and λ a scalar. Then the product of the vector  by the scalar λ, denoted as λ , is called the multiplication of vector  by the scalar λ. Note that, λ is also a vector, collinear to the vector . The vector λ  has the direction same (or opposite) to that of vector  according as the value of λ is positive (or negative). Also, the magnitude of vector λ  is |λ | times the magnitude of the vector , i.e., |λ | = | λ | | | A geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given in Fig 10.12. Fig 10.12 When λ = –1, then λ = – , which is a vector having magnitude equal to the magnitude of  and direction opposite to that of the direction of . The vector –  is called the negative (or additive inverse) of vector  and we always have + (– ) = (– ) +  = 1 Also, if λ =  , provided  ≠ 0 i.e.  is not a null vector, then | a | | λ | = |λ | | | = Reprint 2024-25 a 1 2 a 2a 1 2 a –2 a VECTOR ALGEBRA 347 So, λ  represents the unit vector in the direction of . We write it as 1 r â  = r a | a | r r ANote  For any scalar k, k0 = 0. 10.5.1  Components of a vector Let us take the points A(1, 0, 0), B(0, 1, 0) and C(0, 0, 1) on the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis, respectively. Then, clearly | | = 1, |  | = 1 and | | = 1 The vectors , each having magnitude 1, are called unit vectors along the axes OX, OY and OZ, respectively, and denoted by iˆ,  ˆj   and  kˆ , respectively (Fig 10.13). Fig 10.13 Now, consider the position vector  of a point P (x, y, z) as in Fig 10.14. Let P  be the foot of the perpendicular from P on the plane XOY. 1 Fig 10.14 We, thus, see that P P is parallel to z-axis. As iˆ, ˆj and kˆ  are the unit vectors along the 1 x, y and z-axes, respectively, and by the definition of the coordinates of P, we have . Similarly,  and . Reprint 2024-25 348  MATHEMATICS Therefore, it follows that  = and  = Hence, the position vector of P with reference to O is given by = This form of any vector is called its component form. Here, x, y and z are called as the scalar components of , and xiˆ, yˆj   and zkˆ  are called the vector components of  along the respective axes. Sometimes x, y and z are also termed as rectangular components. The length of any vector r = xiˆ + yˆj + zkˆ , is readily determined by applying the Pythagoras theorem twice. We note that in the right angle triangle OQP  (Fig 10.14) 1 = , and in the right angle triangle OP P, we have 1 = Hence, the length of any vector r  = xiˆ + yˆj + zkˆ  is given by |  |  = If  are any two vectors given in the component form a1i ˆ + a ˆ 2 j + a kˆ3  and b1i ˆ + b ˆj + b kˆ , respectively, then 2 3 (i) the sum (or resultant) of the vectors  is given by = (a1 + b1)iˆ + (a2 + b2 ) ˆj + (a3 + b )kˆ3 (ii) the difference of the vector  is given by = (a1 − b1)iˆ + (a2 − b2 ) ˆj + (a3 − b3 )kˆ (iii) the vectors  are equal if and only if a  = b , a  = b    and   a  = b 1 1 2 2 3 3 (iv) the multiplication of vector  by any scalar λ is given by λ  = (λa1)iˆ + (λa2 ) ˆj + (λa )kˆ3 Reprint 2024-25 VECTOR ALGEBRA 349 The addition of vectors and the multiplication of a vector by a scalar together give the following distributive laws: Let  be any two vectors, and k and m be any scalars. Then (i) (ii) (iii) Remarks (i) One may observe that whatever be the value of λ, the vector λ  is always collinear to the vector . In fact, two vectors  are collinear if and only if there exists a nonzero scalar λ such that . If the vectors  are given in the component form, i.e. a == a iˆ + a ˆ 1 2 j + a3kˆ  and , then the two vectors are collinear if and only if b1i ˆ + b ˆ 2 j + b kˆ  = λ(a iˆ + a ˆj + a ˆ 1 2 3k ) 3 ⇔ b iˆ + b ˆ ˆ 1 2 j + b3k  = (λa ˆ ˆ ˆ 1)i + (λa2 ) j + (λa3)k ⇔ b1 = λa1 , b2 = λa2 , b3 = λa3 b ⇔ 1 b = 2 b = 3 = λ a1 a2 a3 (ii) If a == a iˆ + a ˆ ˆ 1 2 j + a3k , then a , a , a  are also called direction ratios of . 1 2 3 (iii) In case if it is given that  l, m, n are direction cosines of a vector, then liˆ + mˆj + nkˆ = (cosα)iˆ + (cosβ) ˆj + (cos γ)kˆ  is the unit vector in the direction of that vector, where α, β and γ are the angles which the vector makes with x, y and z axes respectively. Example 4 Find the values of x, y and z so that the vectors  and are equal. Solution Note that two vectors are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal. Thus, the given vectors  will be equal if and only if x = 2, y = 2, z = 1 Reprint 2024-25 350  MATHEMATICS Example 5 Let  and . Is ? Are the vectors  equal? Solution We have  and So, . But, the two vectors are not equal since their corresponding components are distinct.

Solution Note that the direction ratio’s a, b, c of a vector  are just the respective components x, y and z of the vector. So, for the given vector, we have a = 1, b = 1 and c = –2.

Then the line segment joining the points P and Q may be divided by a third point, say R, in two ways – internally (Fig 10.16) and externally (Fig 10.17). Here, we intend to find the position vector  for the point R with respect to the origin O. We take the two cases one by one. Case I When R divides PQ internally (Fig 10.16). If R divides  such that  = , Fig 10.16 where m and n are positive scalars, we say that the point R divides  internally in the ratio of m : n.
