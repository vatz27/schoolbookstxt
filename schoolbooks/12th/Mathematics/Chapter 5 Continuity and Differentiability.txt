104  MATHEMATICS Chapter 5 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY vThe whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.” — ALBERT EINSTEIN v 5.1  Introduction This chapter is essentially a continuation of our study of differentiation of functions in Class XI. We had learnt to differentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and trigonometric functions. In this chapter, we introduce the very important concepts of continuity, differentiability and relations between them. We will also learn differentiation of inverse trigonometric functions. Further, we introduce a new class of functions called exponential and logarithmic functions. These functions lead to powerful techniques of differentiation. We illustrate certain geometrically obvious conditions through differential calculus. In the process, we will learn some fundamental theorems in this area. Sir Issac Newton 5.2  Continuity (1642-1727) We start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity. Consider the function 1, if x ≤ 0 f (x) =  2, if x > 0 This function is of course defined at every point of the real line. Graph of this function is given in the Fig 5.1. One can deduce from the graph that the value of the function at nearby points on x-axis remain close to each other except at x = 0. At the points near and to the left of 0, i.e., at points like – 0.1, – 0.01, – 0.001, the value of the function is 1. At the points near and to the right of 0, i.e., at points like 0.1, 0.01, Fig 5.1 Reprint 2024-25 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 105 0.001, the value of the function is 2. Using the language of left and right hand limits, we may say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of f at 0 is 1 (respectively 2). In particular the left and right hand limits do not coincide. We also observe that the value of the function at x = 0 concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw the graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the paper, we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when we come to 0 from left. This is one instance of function being not continuous at x = 0. Now, consider the function defined as 1, if x ≠ 0 f (x) =  2, if x = 0 This function is also defined at every point. Left and the right hand limits at x = 0 are both equal to 1. But the value of the function at x = 0 equals 2 which does not coincide with the common value of the left and right hand limits. Again, we note that we cannot draw the graph of the function without lifting the pen. This is yet another instance of a function being not continuous at x = 0. Naively, we may say that a function is continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the graph of the function around that point without Fig 5.2 lifting the pen from the plane of the paper. Mathematically, it may be phrased precisely as follows: Definition 1 Suppose f is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let  c be a point in the domain of f. Then f is continuous at c if lim f (x) = f (c) x→c More elaborately, if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function at x = c exist and equal to each other, then f is said to be continuous at x = c. Recall that if the right hand and left hand limits at x = c coincide, then we say that the common value is the limit of the function at x = c. Hence we may also rephrase  the definition of continuity as follows: a function is continuous at x = c if the function is defined at x = c and if the value of the function at x = c equals the limit of the function at x = c. If f is not continuous at c, we say f is discontinuous at c and c is called a point of discontinuity of f. Reprint 2024-25 106  MATHEMATICS Example 1 Check the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = 2x + 3 at x = 1. Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 1 and its value is 5. Then find the limit of the function at x = 1. Clearly lim f (x) = lim (2x + 3) = 2(1) + 3 = 5 x→1 x→1 Thus lim f (x) = 5= f (1) x→1 Hence, f is continuous at x = 1. Example 2 Examine whether the function f given by f (x) = x2 is continuous at x = 0. Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 0 and its value is 0. Then find the limit of the function at x = 0. Clearly lim f (x) = lim x2 = 02 = 0 x→0 x→0 Thus lim f (x) = 0 = f (0) x→0 Hence, f is continuous at x = 0. Example 3 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = | x | at x = 0. Solution By definition −x, if x < 0 f (x) =  x, if x ≥ 0 Clearly the function is defined at 0 and f (0) = 0. Left hand limit of f at 0 is lim f (x) = lim (–x) = 0 x→0− x→0− Similarly, the right hand limit of f at 0 is lim f (x) = lim x = 0 x→0+ x→0+ Thus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at x = 0. Hence, f is continuous at x = 0. Example 4 Show that the function f given by x3 + 3, if x ≠ 0 f (x) =  1, if x = 0 is not continuous at x = 0. Reprint 2024-25 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 107 Solution The function is defined at x = 0 and its value at x = 0 is 1. When x ≠ 0, the function is given by a polynomial. Hence, lim f (x) l m 3 03 = i (x + 3) = + 3 = 3 x→0 x→0 Since the limit of f at x = 0 does not coincide with f (0), the function is not continuous at x = 0. It may be noted that x = 0 is the only point of discontinuity for this function. Example 5 Check the points where the constant function f (x) = k is continuous. Solution The function is defined at all real numbers and by definition, its value at any real number equals k. Let c be any real number. Then lim f (x)  = lim k = k x→c x→c Since f (c) = k = lim ( ) f r a y r a  u x→  f x  o  n  e l n mber c, the function f is continuous at c every real number. Example 6 Prove that the identity function on real numbers given by f (x) = x is continuous at every real number. Solution The function is clearly defined at every point and f (c) = c for every real number c. Also, lim f (x)  = lim x = c x→c x→c Thus, lim f (x) = c = f (c) and hence the function is continuous at every real number. x→c Having defined continuity of a function at a given point, now we make a natural extension of this definition to discuss continuity of a function. Definition 2 A real function f is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point in the domain of f. This definition requires a bit of elaboration. Suppose f is a function defined on a closed interval [a, b], then for f to be continuous, it needs to be continuous at every point in [a, b] including the end points a and b. Continuity of f at a means lim f (x) = f (a) x→a+ and continuity of f  at b means lim f (x) = f(b) x→b – Observe that lim f (x)  and lim f (x) do not make sense. As a consequence x→a− x→b+ of this definition, if f is defined only at one point, it is continuous there, i.e., if the domain of f is a singleton, f is a continuous function. Reprint 2024-25 108  MATHEMATICS Example 7 Is the function defined by f (x) = | x |, a continuous function? Solution We may rewrite f as −x, if x < 0 f (x) =  x, if x ≥ 0 By Example 3, we know that f is continuous at x = 0. Let c be a real number such that c < 0. Then f (c) = – c. Also lim f (x)  = lim (−x) = – c           (Why?) x→c x→c Since lim f (x) = f (c) ,  f  is continuous at all negative real numbers. x→c Now, let c be a real number such that c > 0. Then f (c) = c. Also lim f (x) x→  = lim x =c                 (Why?) x→ c c Since lim f (x) = f (c) , f is continuous at all positive real numbers. Hence, f x→c is continuous at all points. Example 8 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = x3 + x2 – 1. Solution Clearly f is defined at every real number c and its value at c is c3 + c2 – 1. We also know that 3 lim ( ) + 2 3 2 f x  = lim (x x −1) =c + c −1 x→c x→c Thus lim f (x) = f (c) , and hence f is continuous at every real number. This means x→c f is a continuous function. 1 Example 9 Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by f (x) = , x ≠ 0. x Solution Fix any non zero real number c, we have 1 1 lim f (x) = lim = x→c x→c x c 1 Also, since for c ≠ 0, f (c) = , we have lim f (x) = f (c)  and hence, f is continuous c x→c at every point in the domain of f. Thus f is a continuous function. Reprint 2024-25 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 109 We take this opportunity to explain the concept of infinity. This we do by analysing 1 the function f (x) =  near x = 0. To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of x finding the value of the function at real numbers close to 0. Essentially we are trying to find the right hand limit of f at 0. We tabulate this in the following (Table 5.1). Table 5.1 x 1 0.3 0.2 0.1 = 10–1 0.01 = 10–2 0.001 = 10–3 10–n f (x) 1 3.333... 5 10 100 = 102 1000 = 103 10n We observe that as x gets closer to 0 from the right, the value of f (x) shoots up higher. This may be rephrased as: the value of f (x) may be made larger than any given number by choosing a positive real number very close to 0. In symbols, we write lim f (x) = + ∞ x→0+ (to be read as: the right hand limit of f (x) at 0 is plus infinity). We wish to emphasise that + ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real number). Similarly, the left hand limit of f  at 0 may be found. The following table is self explanatory. Table 5.2 x – 1 – 0.3 – 0.2 – 10–1 – 10–2 – 10–3 – 10–n f (x) – 1 – 3.333... – 5 – 10 – 102 – 103 – 10n From the Table 5.2, we deduce that the value of f (x) may be made smaller than any given number by choosing a negative real number very close to 0. In symbols, we write lim f (x) = − ∞ x→0− (to be read as: the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is minus infinity). Again, we wish to emphasise that – ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the left hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real number). The graph of the reciprocal function given in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation of the above mentioned facts. Fig 5.3 Reprint 2024-25 110  MATHEMATICS Example 10 Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by x + 2, if x ≤ 1 f (x) =  x − 2, if x > 1 Solution The function f is defined at all points of the real line. Case 1 If c < 1, then f (c) = c + 2. Therefore, lim f (x) = lim(x + 2) = c + 2 x→c x→c Thus, f is continuous at all real numbers less than 1. Case 2 If c > 1, then f (c) = c – 2. Therefore, lim f (x) = lim (x – 2) = c – 2 = f (c) x→c x→c Thus, f is continuous at all points x > 1. Case 3 If c = 1, then the left hand limit of f at x = 1 is lim f (x) = lim (x + 2) =1+ 2 = 3 – – x→1 x→1 The right hand limit of f at x = 1 is lim f (x) = lim (x − 2) = 1− 2 = −1 + + x→1 x→1 Since the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1 Fig  5.4 do not coincide, f  is not continuous at x = 1. Hence x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The graph of the function is given in Fig 5.4. Example 11 Find all the points of discontinuity of the function f defined by x + 2, if x <1  f (x) =  0, if x =1  x − 2, if x >1 Solution As in the previous example we find that f is continuous at all real numbers x ≠ 1. The left hand limit of f at x = 1 is lim f (x) = lim (x + 2) =1+ 2 = 3 − x→ – 1 x→1 The right hand limit of f at x = 1 is lim f (x) = lim (x − 2) = 1− 2 = −1 + + x→1 x→1 Since, the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1 do not coincide, f is not continuous at x = 1. Hence x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The graph of the function is given in the Fig 5.5. Fig  5.5 Reprint 2024-25 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 111 Example 12 Discuss the continuity of the function defined by  x + 2, if x < 0 f (x) =  −x + 2, if x > 0 Solution Observe that the function is defined at all real numbers except at 0. Domain of definition of this function is D  ∪ D  where  D  = {x ∈ R : x < 0} and 1 2 1 D  = {x ∈ R : x > 0} 2 Case 1 If c ∈ D , then lim f (x) = lim  (x + 2) 1 x→c x→c = c + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D . 1 Case 2 If c ∈ D , then lim f (x) = lim  (– x + 2) 2 x→c x→c = – c + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D . 2 Since f is continuous at all points in the domain of f, we deduce that f is continuous. Graph of this function is given in the Fig 5.6. Note that to graph Fig 5.6 this function we need to lift the pen from the plane of the paper, but we need to do that only for those points where the function is not defined. Example 13 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by x, if x ≥ 0 f (x) =   2 x , if x < 0 Solution Clearly the function is defined at every real number. Graph of the function is given in Fig 5.7. By inspection, it seems prudent to partition the domain of definition of f into three disjoint subsets of the real line. Let D  = {x ∈ R : x < 0}, D  = {0} and 1 2 Fig 5.7 D  = {x ∈ R : x > 0} 3 Case 1 At any point in D , we have f (x) = x2 and it is easy to see that it is continuous 1 there (see Example 2). Case 2 At any point in D , we have f (x) = x and it is easy to see that it is continuous 3 there (see Example 6). Reprint 2024-25 112  MATHEMATICS Case 3 Now we analyse the function at x = 0. The value of the function at 0 is f (0) = 0. The left hand limit of  f at 0 is lim f (x) = lim x2 = 02 = 0 x→0– x→0− The right hand limit of f at 0 is lim f (x) = lim x = 0 → + + x 0 x→0 Thus lim f (x) = 0 = f (0) and hence f is continuous at 0. This means that f is x→0 continuous at every point in its domain and hence, f is a continuous function. Example 14 Show that every polynomial function is continuous. Solution Recall that a function p is a polynomial function if it is defined by p(x) = a  + a  x + ... + a  xn for some natural number n, a  ≠ 0 and a  ∈ R. Clearly this 0 1 n n i function is defined for every real number. For a fixed real number c, we have lim p (x) = p (c) x→c By definition, p is continuous at c. Since c is any real number, p is continuous at every real number and hence p is a continuous function. Example 15  Find all the points of discontinuity of the greatest integer function defined by f (x) = [x], where [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Solution First observe that f is defined for all real numbers. Graph of the function is given in Fig 5.8. From the graph it looks like that f is discontinuous at every integral point. Below we explore, if this is true. Fig 5.8 Reprint 2024-25 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 113 Case 1 Let c be a real number which is not equal to any integer. It is evident from the graph that for all real numbers close to c the value of the function is equal to [c]; i.e., lim f (x) = lim [x] = [c] . Also f (c) = [c] and hence the function is continuous at all real x→c x→c numbers not equal to integers. Case 2 Let c be an integer. Then we can find a sufficiently small real number r > 0 such that [c – r] = c – 1 whereas [c + r] = c. This, in terms of limits mean that lim f (x) = c – 1, lim f (x) = c → − + x c x→c Since these limits cannot be equal to each other for any c, the function is discontinuous at every integral point. 5.2.1  Algebra of continuous functions In the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some algebra of limits. Analogously, now we will study some algebra of continuous functions. Since continuity of a function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at that point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits. Theorem 1 Suppose f and g be two real functions continuous at a real number c. Then (1) f + g is continuous at x = c. (2) f – g is continuous at x = c. (3) f . g is continuous at x = c.  f  (4)   s c n i u u  t x g  i  o t n o s a   = c, (provided g (c) ≠ 0).   Proof We are investigating continuity of (f + g) at x = c. Clearly it is defined at x = c. We have lim( f + g) (x)  = lim [ f (x) + g(x)] (by definition of f + g) x→c x→c = lim f (x) + lim g(x) (by the theorem on limits) x→c x→c = f (c) + g(c) (as f and g are continuous) = (f + g) (c) (by definition of f + g) Hence, f + g is continuous at x = c. Proofs for the remaining parts are similar and left as an exercise to the reader. Reprint 2024-25 114  MATHEMATICS Remarks (i) As a special case of (3) above, if f is a constant function, i.e., f (x) = λ for some real number λ, then the function (λ . g) defined by (λ . g) (x) = λ . g(x) is also continuous. In particular if λ = – 1, the continuity of f implies continuity of – f. (ii) As a special case of (4) above, if f is the constant function f (x) = λ, then the λ λ λ function  defined by (x) = is also continuous wherever g (x) ≠ 0. In g g g(x) 1 particular, the continuity of g implies continuity of . g The above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions. They also aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not. The following examples illustrate this: Example 16 Prove that every rational function is continuous. Solution Recall that every rational function f is given by p(x) f (x) = , q(x) ≠ 0 q(x) where p and q are polynomial functions. The domain of f is all real numbers except points at which q is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14), f is continuous by (4) of  Theorem 1. Example 17 Discuss the continuity of sine function. Solution To see this we use the following facts lim sin x = 0 x→0 We have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of sin x near 0. Now, observe that f (x) = sin x is defined for every real number. Let c be a real number. Put x = c + h. If x → c we know that h → 0. Therefore lim f (x)  = lim sin x x→c x→c = lim sin(c + h) h→0 = lim [sin ccos h + cosc sin h] h→0 = lim [sin ccosh] + lim [cosc sin h] h→0 h→0 = sin c + 0 = sin c = f (c) Thus lim  f (x) = f (c) and hence f is a continuous function. x→c Reprint 2024-25 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 115 Remark A similar proof may be given for the continuity of cosine function. Example 18 Prove that the function defined by f (x) = tan x is a continuous function. sin x Solution The function f (x) = tan x = . This is defined for all real numbers such cos x π that cos x ≠ 0, i.e., x ≠ (2n +1) . We have just proved that both sine and cosine 2 functions are continuous. Thus tan x being a quotient of two continuous functions is continuous wherever it is defined. An interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to composition of functions. Recall that if f and g are two real functions, then (f o g) (x) = f (g (x)) is defined whenever the range of g is a subset of domain of f. The following theorem (stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions. Theorem 2 Suppose f and g are real valued functions such that (f o g) is defined at c. If g is continuous at c and if f is continuous at g (c), then (f o g) is continuous at c. The following examples illustrate this theorem. Example 19 Show that the function defined by f (x) = sin (x2) is a continuous function. Solution Observe that the function is defined for every real number. The function f may be thought of as a composition g o h of the two functions g and h, where g (x) = sin x and h (x) = x2. Since both g and h are continuous functions, by Theorem 2, it can be deduced that f is a continuous function. Example 20 Show that the function f defined by f (x) = |1 – x + | x | |, where x is any real number, is a continuous function. Solution Define g by g (x) = 1 – x + | x | and  h by h (x) = | x | for all real x. Then (h o g) (x) = h (g (x)) = h (1– x + | x |) = | 1– x + | x | | = f (x) In Example 7, we have seen that h is a continuous function. Hence g being a sum of a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then f  being a composite of two continuous functions is continuous.
