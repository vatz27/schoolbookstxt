34 MATHEMATICS Chapter 3 MATRICES vThe essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom. — CANTOR v 3.1  Introduction The knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics. Matrices are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and simple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices far exceeds that use. Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet programs for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an experiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices are also used in cryptography. This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology, modern psychology and industrial management. In this chapter, we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra. 3.2  Matrix Suppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks. We may express it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of notebooks that Radha has. Now, if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens. We may express it as [15  6] with the understanding that first number inside [ ] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number of pens possessed by Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possession Reprint 2024-25 MATRICES         35 of notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which is as follows: Radha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens, Fauzia has 10 notebooks and 2 pens, Simran has 13 notebooks and 5 pens. Now this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows: Notebooks Pens Radha 15 6 Fauzia 10 2 Simran 13 5 and this can be expressed as or Radha Fauzia Simran Notebooks 15 10 13 Pens 6 2 5 which can be expressed as: In the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of note books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the second column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, Reprint 2024-25 36 MATHEMATICS respectively. Similarly, in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. The entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a matrix. Formally, we define matrix as: Definition 1  A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix. We denote matrices by capital letters. The following are some examples of matrices:  1 + −   2 – 2 5   i 3 2     1+ x 3 x 3  A =  0 5 , B =  3.5 –1 2  ,  C =    3 6   5  cos x sin x + 2 tan x   3 5   7  In the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns of the matrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2 rows and 3 columns. 3.2.1  Order of a matrix A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n or simply m × n matrix (read as an m by n matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we have A as 3 × 2 matrix, B as 3 × 3 matrix and C as 2 × 3 matrix. We observe that A has 3 × 2 = 6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively. In general, an m × n matrix has the following rectangular array: or A = [a ] , 1≤ i ≤ m, 1≤ j ≤ n   i, j ∈ N ij m × n Thus the ith  row consists of the elements a , a , a ,..., a , while the jth column i1 i2 i3 in consists of the elements a , a , a ,..., a , 1j 2j 3j mj In general a , is an element lying in the ith row and jth column. We can also call ij it as the (i, j)th element of A. The number of elements in an m × n matrix will be equal to mn. Reprint 2024-25 MATRICES         37 ANote  In this chapter 1. We shall follow the notation, namely A = [a ]  to indicate that A is a matrix ij m × n of order m × n. 2. We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or functions taking real values. We can also represent any point (x, y) in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as  x    (or [x, y]). For example point P(0, 1) as a matrix representation may be given as  y 0 P =    or [0 1]. 1 Observe that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear figure in the form of a matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices A (1, 0), B (3, 2), C (1, 3), D (–1, 2). Now, quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as A B C D A  1 0 1 3 1 −1   B 3 2 X =   or Y =   0 2 3 2 × C  1 3 2 4   D −1 24×2 Thus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in a plane. Now, let us consider some examples. Example 1 Consider the following information regarding the number of men and women workers in three factories I, II and III Men workers Women workers I 30 25 II 25 31 III 27 26 Represent the above information in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix. What does the entry in the third row and second column represent? Reprint 2024-25 38 MATHEMATICS Solution The information is represented in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix as follows: 30 25 =   A 25 31 27 26 The entry in the third row and second column represents the number of women workers in factory III. Example 2 If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have? Solution We know that if a matrix is of order m × n, it has mn elements. Thus, to find all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural numbers, whose product is 8. Thus, all possible ordered pairs are (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4) Hence, possible orders are 1 × 8, 8 ×1, 4 × 2, 2 × 4 1 Example 3 Construct a 3 × 2 matrix whose elements are given by aij = | i − 3 j | . 2 a11 a12  Solution In general a 3 × 2 matrix is given by =   A . a21 a22  a31 a  32  1 Now aij = | i − 3 j | , i = 1, 2, 3 and  j = 1, 2. 2 1 1 5 Therefore a11 = |1− 3×1| =1 a12 = |1− 3× 2 | = 2 2 2 1 1 1 a21 = | 2 − 3×1| = a22 = | 2 − 3× 2 | = 2 2 2 2 1 1 3 a31 = | 3 − 3×1| = 0 a32 = | 3 − 3× 2 | = 2 2 2  5  1  2  1  Hence the required matrix is given by A =  2  .  2 3  0   2  Reprint 2024-25 MATRICES         39 3.3  Types of Matrices In this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices. (i) Column matrix A matrix is said to be a column matrix if it has only one column.  0     3  For example,  A =  −1   is a column matrix of order 4 × 1.   1/ 2 In general, A = [a ]  is a column matrix of order m × 1. ij m × 1 (ii) Row matrix A matrix is said to be a row matrix if it has only one row.  1 For example, =  B − 5 2 3  is  2   a row matrix. 1×4 In general, B = [b ]  is a row matrix of order 1 × n. ij 1 × n (iii) Square matrix A matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is said to be a square matrix. Thus an m × n matrix is said to be a square matrix if m = n and is known as a square matrix of order ‘n’. 3 −1 0    For example 3 A = 3 2 1   is a square matrix of order 3. 2  4 3 −1 In general, A = [a ]  is a square matrix of order m. ij m × m ANote  If A = [a ] is a square matrix of order n, then elements (entries) a , a , ..., a ij 11 22 nn 1 −3 1  are said to constitute the diagonal, of the matrix A. Thus, if =   −  A 2 4 1 . 3 5 6  Then the elements of the diagonal of A are 1, 4, 6. Reprint 2024-25 40 MATHEMATICS (iv) Diagonal matrix A square matrix B = [b ]  is said to be a diagonal matrix if all its non ij m × m diagonal elements are zero, that is a matrix B = [b ]  is said to be a diagonal ij m × m matrix if b  = 0, when i ≠ j. ij −1.1 0 0 −1 0 =   For example,  A = [4], B =   , C  0 2 0 , are diagonal matrices  0 2  0 0 3 of order 1, 2, 3, respectively. (v) Scalar matrix A diagonal matrix is said to be a scalar matrix if its diagonal elements are equal, that is, a square matrix B = [b ]  is said to be a scalar matrix if ij n × n b  = 0,    when i  ≠ j ij b  = k,    when i  = j, for some constant k. ij For example  3 0 0  −1 0    A = [3],     B =  −  ,    C =  0 3 0   0 1    0 0 3 are scalar matrices of order 1, 2 and 3, respectively. (vi) Identity matrix A square matrix in which elements in the diagonal are all 1 and rest are all zero is called an identity matrix. In other words, the square matrix A = [a ]  is an ij n × n 1 if i = j identity matrix, if aij =  . 0 if i ≠ j We denote the identity matrix of order n by I . When order is clear from the n context, we simply write it as I. 1 0 0 1 0   For example [1],   0 1 0 ,   are identity matrices of order 1, 2 and 3, 0 1 0 0 1 respectively. Observe that a scalar matrix is an identity matrix when k = 1. But every identity matrix is clearly a scalar matrix. Reprint 2024-25 MATRICES         41 (vii) Zero matrix A matrix is said to be zero matrix or null matrix if all its elements are zero. 0 0 0 0 0 For example, [0],   ,   , [0, 0] are all zero matrices. We denote 0 0 0 0 0 zero matrix by O. Its order will be clear from the context. 3.3.1  Equality of matrices Definition 2 Two matrices A = [a ] and B = [b ] are said to be equal if ij ij (i) they are of the same order (ii) each element of A is equal to the corresponding element of B, that is a  = b  for ij ij all i and j. 2 3 2 3 3 2 2 3 For example,   and    are equal matrices but   and    are 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 not equal matrices. Symbolically, if two matrices A and B are equal, we write A = B. x y −1.5 0  If   =   z a  2 6 , then x = – 1.5, y = 0, z = 2, a = 6 , b = 3, c = 2 b c  3 2  x + 3 z + 4 2y − 7  0 6 3y − 2     Example 4 If   −6 a −1 0  = −6 −3 2c + 2 b − 3 − 21 0  2b + 4 − 21 0  Find the values of a, b, c, x, y and z. Solution As the given matrices are equal, therefore, their corresponding elements must be equal. Comparing the corresponding elements, we get x + 3 = 0, z + 4 = 6, 2y – 7 = 3y – 2 a – 1 = – 3, 0 = 2c + 2 b – 3 = 2b + 4, Simplifying, we get a = – 2, b = – 7, c = – 1, x = – 3, y = –5, z = 2 Example 5 Find the values of a, b, c, and d from the following equation: 2a + b a − 2b   4 −3   =   5c − d 4c + 3d  11 24 Reprint 2024-25 42 MATHEMATICS Solution By equality of two matrices, equating the corresponding elements, we get 2a + b = 4 5c – d = 11 a – 2b = – 3 4c + 3d = 24 Solving these equations, we get a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 and d = 4 EXERCISE 3.1  2 5 19 −7   5 1.

Each factory produces sport shoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3. The quantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below: Suppose Fatima wants to know the total production of sport shoes in each price category. Then the total production In category 1 : for boys (80 + 90), for girls (60 + 50) In category 2 : for boys (75 + 70), for girls (65 + 55) In category 3 : for boys (90 + 75), for girls (85 + 75) 80 + 90 60 + 50 This can be represented in the matrix form as   + +  75 70 65 55 . 90 + 75 85 + 75 Reprint 2024-25 44 MATHEMATICS This new matrix is the sum of the above two matrices. We observe that the sum of two matrices is a matrix obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the given matrices. Furthermore, the two matrices have to be of the same order. a Thus, if = 11 a12 a13  b11 b12 b13  A    is a 2 × 3 matrix and B =    is another a21 a22 a23  b21 b22 b23  a + b a + b a + b  2×3 matrix. Then, we define A + B = 11 11 12 12 13 13  .  + + +  a21 b21 a22 b22 a23 b23  In general, if A = [a ] and B = [b ] are two matrices of the same order, say m × n. ij ij Then, the sum of the two matrices A and B is defined as a matrix C = [c ] , where ij m × n c  = a  + b , for all possible values of i and j. ij ij ij   5 1 3 1 −1 2 Example 6  Given A =    and B =    1 , f  2 3 0 −2 3  ind A + B  2 Since A, B are of the same order 2 × 3. Therefore, addition of A and B is defined and is given by 2 + 3 1+ 5 1−1 2 + 3 1+ 5 0 A + B =   1 =    1 2 − 2 3 + 3 0 +  0 6   2  2 ANote 1. We emphasise that if A and B are not of the same order, then A + B is not 2 3 1 2 3 defined. For example if A =   , B =   ,  then A + B is not defined. 1 0 1 0 1 2. We may observe that addition of matrices is an example of binary operation on the set of matrices of the same order. 3.4.2  Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar Now suppose that Fatima has doubled the production at a factory A in all categories (refer to 3.4.1). Reprint 2024-25 MATRICES         45 Previously quantities (in standard units) produced by factory A  were Revised quantities produced by factory A are as given below: Boys Girls 1 2×80 2× 60   2 2× 75 2×65 3 2×90 2×85 160 120 This can be represented in the matrix form as   150 130 . We observe that 180 170 the new matrix is obtained by multiplying each element of the previous matrix by 2. In general, we may define multiplication of a matrix by a scalar as follows: if A = [a ]  is a matrix and k is a scalar, then kA is another matrix which is obtained ij m × n by multiplying each element of A by the scalar k. In other words, kA = k [a ]  = [k (a )] , that is, (i, j)th element of kA is ka ij m × n ij m × n ij for all possible values of i and j.  3 1 1.5   For example, if A =  5 7 −3 , then  2 0 5   3 1 1.5  9 3 4.5     3A = 3  5 7 −3 = 3 5 21 −9   2 0 5   6 0 15  Negative of a matrix The negative of a matrix is denoted by – A.

In other words, D = A – B = A + (–1) B, that is sum of the matrix A and the matrix – B. 1 2 3  3 −1 3  Example 7 If A =   and B =  t e 2 3 1 −  , h n find 2A – B.  1 0 2 Solution We have 1 2 3 3 −1 3 2A – B = 2   −  −  2 3 1 1 0 2 2 4 6 −3 1 −3 =   +  4 6 2 −     1 0 2 2 − 3 4 +1 6 − 3  −1 5 3 =   =  + + −   4 1 6 0 2 2  5 6 0 3.4.3  Properties of matrix addition The addition of matrices satisfy the following properties: (i) Commutative Law  If A = [a ], B = [b ] are matrices of the same order, say ij ij m × n, then A + B = B + A. Now A + B = [a ] + [b ] = [a  + b ] ij ij ij ij = [b  + a ] (addition of numbers is commutative) ij ij = ([b ] + [a ]) = B + A ij ij (ii) Associative Law  For any three matrices A = [a ], B = [b ], C = [c ] of the ij ij ij same order, say m × n, (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). Now (A + B) + C = ([a ] + [b ]) + [c ] ij ij ij = [a  + b ] + [c ] = [(a  + b ) + c ] ij ij ij ij ij ij = [a  + (b  + c )] (Why?) ij ij ij = [a ] + [(b  + c )] = [a ] + ([b ] + [c ]) = A + (B + C) ij ij ij ij ij ij Reprint 2024-25 MATRICES         47 (iii) Existence of additive identity Let A = [a ] be an m × n matrix and ij O be an m × n zero matrix, then A + O = O + A = A. In other words, O is the additive identity for matrix addition. (iv) The existence of additive inverse Let A = [a ]  be any matrix, then we ij m × n have another matrix as – A = [– a ]  such that A + (– A) = (– A) + A= O. So ij m × n – A is the additive inverse of A or negative of A. 3.4.4  Properties of scalar multiplication of a matrix If A = [a ] and B = [b ] be two matrices of the same order, say m × n, and k and l are ij ij scalars, then (i) k(A +B) = k A + kB, (ii) (k + l)A = k A + l A (ii) k (A + B) = k ([a ] + [b ]) ij ij = k [a  + b ] = [k (a  + b )] = [(k a ) + (k b )] ij ij ij ij ij ij = [k a ] + [k b ] = k [a ] + k [b ] = kA + kB ij ij ij ij (iii) ( k + l) A  = (k + l) [a ] ij = [(k + l) a ] + [k a ] + [l a ] = k [a ] + l [a ] = k A + l A ij ij ij ij ij 8 0  2 −2 =    Example 8 If A 4 −2 and B =   4 2  , then find the matrix X, such that 3 6  −5 1  2A + 3X = 5B.
