406 MATHEMATICS Chapter 13 PROBABILITY vThe theory of probabilities is simply the Science of logic quantitatively treated. – C.S. PEIRCE v 13.1  Introduction In earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a measure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment. We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by Russian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) and treated probability as a function of outcomes of the experiment. We have also established equivalence between the axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability in case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this relationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated with discrete sample spaces. We have also studied the addition rule of probability. In this chapter, we shall discuss the important concept of conditional probability of an event given that another event has occurred, which will be helpful in understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of Pierre de Fermat probability and independence of events. We shall also learn (1601-1665) an  important concept of  random variable and its probability distribution and also the mean and variance of a probability  distribution. In the last section of the chapter, we shall study an important discrete probability distribution called  Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter, we shall take up the experiments having equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise. 13.2  Conditional Probability Uptill now in probability, we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of events. If we have two events from the same sample space, does the information about the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes are equally likely to occur. Consider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the experiment is S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT} Reprint 2024-25 PROBABILITY      407 1 Since the coins are fair, we can assign the probability    to each sample point. Let 8 E be the event ‘at least two heads appear’ and  F be the event ‘first coin shows tail’. Then E = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH} and F = {THH, THT, TTH, TTT} Therefore P(E) = P ({HHH}) + P ({HHT}) + P ({HTH}) + P ({THH}) 1 1 1 1 1 = + + + =  (Why ?) 8 8 8 8 2 and P(F) = P ({THH}) + P ({THT}) + P ({TTH}) + P ({TTT}) 1 1 1 1 1 = + + + = 8 8 8 8 2 Also E ∩ F = {THH} 1 with P(E ∩ F) = P({THH}) = 8 Now, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e. F occurs, then what is the probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F, we are sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered while finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the set S to its subset F for the event E. In other words, the additional information really amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F. Now, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH. 1 Thus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space = , 4 1 or Probability of E given that the event F has occurred = 4 This probability of the event E is called the conditional probability of E given that F has already occurred, and is denoted by P (E|F). 1 Thus P(E|F) = 4 Note that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of E and F, i.e. the sample points of E ∩ F. Reprint 2024-25 408 MATHEMATICS Thus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as Numberof elementaryeventsfavourable to E∩F P(E|F) = Numberof elementaryevents whicharefavourable to F n (E ∩ F) = n (F) Dividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events of the sample space, we see that P(E|F) can also be written as n(E ∩ F) n(S) P(E ∩ F) P(E|F) = = ... (1) n(F) P(F) n(S) Note that (1) is valid only when P(F) ≠ 0 i.e., F ≠ φ (Why?) Thus, we can define the conditional probability as follows : Definition 1 If  E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a random experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred, i.e. P (E|F) is given by P(E ∩F) P(E|F) =  provided P(F) ≠ 0 P(F) 13.2.1  Properties of conditional probability Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have Property 1 P (S|F) = P(F|F) = 1 We know that P(S∩F) P(F) P(S|F) = = =1 P(F) P(F) P(F∩F) P(F) Also P(F|F) = = =1 P(F) P(F) Thus P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1 Property 2 If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event of S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A ∩ B)|F) Reprint 2024-25 PROBABILITY      409 In particular, if A and B are disjoint events, then P((A∪B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) We have P[(A∪B) ∩F] P((A ∪B)|F) = P(F) P[(A∩F) ∪ (B∩F)] = P(F) (by distributive law of union of sets over  intersection) P(A∩F)+ P(B∩F) – P(A∩B ∩ F) = P(F) P(A∩F) P(B∩F) P[(A∩B) ∩ F] = + − P(F) P(F) P(F) = P(A|F) + P (B|F) – P ((A ∩B)|F) When A and B are disjoint events, then P((A ∩ B)|F) = 0 ⇒ P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) Property 3 P (E′|F) = 1 − P (E|F) From Property 1, we know that P(S|F) = 1 ⇒ P(E ∪ E′|F) = 1    since  S = E ∪ E′ ⇒ P(E|F) + P (E′|F) = 1     since E and E′ are disjoint events Thus, P (E′|F) = 1 − P (E|F) Let us now take up some examples. 7 9 4 Example 1 If P (A) = , P(B) =  and P (A ∩ B) = , evaluate P (A|B). 13 13 13 4 P(A ∩B) 4 Solution We have P(A|B)= = 13 = P(B) 9 9 13 Example 2 A family has two children. What is the probability that both the children are boys given that at least one of them is a boy ? Reprint 2024-25 410 MATHEMATICS Solution Let b stand for boy and g for girl. The sample space of the experiment is S = {(b, b), (g, b), (b, g), (g, g)} Let E and F denote the following events : E : ‘both the children are boys’ F : ‘at least one of the child is a boy’ Then E = {(b,b)} and F = {(b,b), (g,b), (b,g)} Now E ∩ F = {(b,b)} 3 1 Thus P(F) =  and P (E ∩ F )= 4 4 1 P(E ∩F) 4 1 Therefore P(E|F) = = = P( F) 3 3 4 Example 3  Ten cards  numbered 1 to 10 are placed in a box, mixed up thoroughly and then one card is drawn randomly. If it is known that the number on the drawn card is more than 3, what is the probability that it is an even number? Solution Let A be the event ‘the number on the card drawn is even’ and B be the event ‘the number on the card drawn is  greater than 3’. We have to find P(A|B). Now, the sample space of the experiment is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} Then A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10},  B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and A ∩ B = {4, 6, 8, 10} 5 7 4 Also P(A) = , P (B) = and P(A∩B) = 10 10 10 4 P(A ∩B) 10 4 Then P(A|B) = = = P(B) 7 7 10 Example 4 In a school, there are 1000 students, out of which 430 are girls. It is known that out of 430, 10% of the girls study in class XII. What is the probability that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XII given that the chosen student is a girl? Solution Let E denote the event that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XII and F be the event that the randomly chosen student is a girl. We have to find P (E|F).

What is the conditional probability that the number 4 has appeared at least once? Solution  Let E be the event that ‘number 4 appears at least once’ and F be the event that ‘the sum of the numbers appearing is 6’. Then, E = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)} and F = {(1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1)} 11 5 We have P(E) = and P (F) = 36 36 Also E ∩F = {(2,4), (4,2)} Reprint 2024-25 412 MATHEMATICS 2 Therefore P(E ∩F) = 36 Hence, the required probability 2 P(E ∩F) 36 2 P(E|F) = = = P(F) 5 5 36 For the conditional probability discussed above, we have considered the elementary events of the experiment to be equally likely and the corresponding definition of the probability of an event was used. However, the same definition can also be used in the general case where the elementary events of the sample space are not equally likely, the probabilities P (E ∩F) and P (F) being calculated accordingly. Let us take up the following example. Example 7 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. If the coin shows head, toss it again but if it shows tail, then throw a die.  Find the conditional probability of the event that ‘the die shows a number greater than 4’ given that ‘there is at least one tail’. Solution The outcomes of the experiment can be represented in following diagrammatic manner called the ‘tree diagram’. The sample space of the experiment may be Fig 13.1 described as S = {(H,H), (H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6)} where (H, H) denotes that both the tosses result into head and (T, i) denote the first toss result into a tail and the number i appeared on the die for i = 1,2,3,4,5,6. Thus, the probabilities assigned to the 8 elementary events (H, H), (H, T), (T, 1), (T, 2), (T, 3) (T, 4), (T, 5), (T, 6) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 are , , , , , , ,  respectively which  is 4 4 12 12 12 12 12 12 clear from the Fig 13.2.

Then F = {(H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6)} E = {(T,5), (T,6)} and E ∩ F = {(T,5), (T,6)} Now P(F) = P({(H,T)}) + P ({(T,1)}) + P ({(T,2)}) + P ({(T,3)}) + P ({(T,4)}) + P({(T,5)}) + P({(T,6)}) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 = + + + + + + = 4 12 12 12 12 12 12 4 1 1 1 and P(E ∩ F) = P ({(T,5)}) + P ({(T,6)}) = + = 12 12 6 1 P(E ∩F) 6 2 Hence P(E|F) = = = P(F) 3 9 4 EXERCISE 13.1 1.

Clearly, the set E ∩ F denotes the event that both E and F have occurred. In other words, E ∩ F denotes the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F. The event E ∩ F is also written as EF. Very often we need to find the probability of  the event EF. For example, in the experiment of drawing two cards one after the other, we may be interested in finding the probability of the event ‘a king and a queen’. The probability of event EF is obtained by using the conditional probability as obtained below : We know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is denoted by P(E|F) and is given by P(E ∩F) P(E|F) = ,P (F)≠0 P(F) From this result, we can write P (E ∩ F) = P(F) . P (E|F) ... (1) Also, we know that P(F ∩E) P(F|E) = ,P (E)≠0 P(E) P(E ∩F) or P(F|E) =  (since E ∩ F = F ∩ E) P(E) Thus, P(E ∩ F) = P(E). P(F|E) .... (2) Combining (1) and (2), we find that P (E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E) = P(F) P(E|F) provided P(E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0. The above result is known as the multiplication rule of probability. Let us now take up an example. Example 8  An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the urn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn balls are black? Solution Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn are black. We have to find P (E ∩ F) or P (EF). Reprint 2024-25 416 MATHEMATICS 10 Now P(E) = P (black ball in first draw) = 15 Also given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred. 9 i.e. P(F|E) = 14 By multiplication rule of probability, we have P (E ∩ F) = P(E) P (F|E) 10 9 3 = × = 15 14 7 Multiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are three events of sample space, we have P(E ∩ F ∩ G) = P (E) P (F|E) P (G|(E ∩ F)) = P (E) P (F|E) P (G|EF) Similarly, the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or more events. The following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability for three events. Example 9 Three cards are drawn successively, without replacement from a pack of 52 well shuffled cards. What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the third card drawn is an ace? Solution Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that the card drawn is an ace. Clearly, we have to find P (KKA) 4 Now P(K) = 52 Also, P (K|K) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has already been drawn. Now there are three kings in (52 − 1) = 51 cards. 3 Therefore P(K|K) = 51 Lastly, P(A|KK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition that two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 50 cards. Reprint 2024-25 PROBABILITY      417 4 Therefore P(A|KK) = 50 By multiplication law of probability, we have P(KKA) = P(K)   P(K|K)  P(A|KK) 4 3 4 2 = × × = 52 51 50 5525 13.4  Independent Events Consider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which the elementary events are assumed to be equally likely. If E and F denote the events 'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively, then 13 1 4 1 P(E) = = and P(F) = = 52 4 52 13 Also E and F is the event ' the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that 1 P(E ∩F) = 52 1 P(E ∩F) 52 1 Hence P(E|F) = = = P(F) 1 4 13 1 Since P(E) = = P (E|F), we can say that the occurrence of event F has not 4 affected the probability of occurrence of the event E. We also have 1 P(E ∩F) 52 1 P(F|E) = = = = P(F) P(E) 1 13 4 1 Again,  P (F) =  = P (F|E) shows that occurrence of event E has not affected 13 the probability of occurrence of the event F. Thus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of them is not affected by occurrence of the other. Such events are called independent events. Reprint 2024-25 418 MATHEMATICS Definition 2 Two events E and F are said to be independent, if P (F|E) = P (F)  provided P (E)  ≠ 0 and P (E|F) = P (E)  provided P (F)  ≠ 0 Thus, in this definition we need to have P (E) ≠ 0 and  P(F) ≠ 0 Now, by the multiplication rule of probability, we have P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F|E) ... (1) If E and F are independent, then (1) becomes P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F) ... (2) Thus, using (2), the independence of two events is also defined as follows: Definition 3 Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment, then E and F are said to be independent if P (E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F) Remarks (i) Two events E and F are said to be dependent if they are not independent, i.e. if P(E ∩ F ) ≠ P (E) . P (F) (ii) Sometimes there is a confusion between independent events and mutually exclusive events. Term ‘independent’ is defined in terms of ‘probability of events’ whereas mutually exclusive is defined in term of events (subset of sample space). Moreover, mutually exclusive events never have an outcome common, but independent events, may have common outcome. Clearly, ‘independent’ and ‘mutually exclusive’ do not have the same meaning. In other words, two independent events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be mutually exclusive, and conversely, i.e. two mutually exclusive events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be independent. (iii) Two experiments are said to be independent if for every pair of events E and F, where E is associated with the first experiment and F with the second experiment, the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F when the two experiments are performed is the product of P(E) and P(F) calculated separately on the basis of two experiments, i.e., P (E ∩ F) = P (E) . P(F) (iv) Three events A, B and C are said to be mutually independent, if P (A ∩ B) = P(A) P (B) P(A ∩ C) = P(A) P (C) P (B ∩ C) = P(B) P(C) and P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A) P (B) P (C) Reprint 2024-25 PROBABILITY      419 If at least one of the above is not true for three given events, we say that the events are not independent. Example 10 A die is thrown. If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of 3’ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even’ then find whether E and F are independent ? Solution We know that the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} Now E = { 3, 6}, F = { 2, 4, 6} and  E ∩ F = {6} 2 1 3 1 1 Then P(E) = = , P(F)= = and P(E∩  F)= 6 3 6 2 6 Clearly P(E ∩ F) = P(E). P (F) Hence E and F are independent events. Example 11 An unbiased die is thrown twice. Let the event A be ‘odd number on the first throw’ and B the event ‘odd number on the second throw’. Check the independence of the events A and B. Solution If all the 36 elementary events of the experiment are considered to be equally likely, we have 18 1 18 1 P(A) = =  and P(B)= = 36 2 36 2 Also P(A ∩ B) = P (odd number on both throws) 9 1 = = 36 4 1 1 1 Now P(A) P(B) = × = 2 2 4 Clearly P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P (B) Thus, A and B are independent events Example 12 Three coins are tossed simultaneously. Consider the event E ‘three heads or three tails’, F ‘at least two heads’ and G ‘at most two heads’. Of the pairs (E,F), (E,G) and (F,G), which are independent? which are dependent? Solution The sample space of the experiment is given by S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT} Clearly E = {HHH, TTT}, F= {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH} Reprint 2024-25 420 MATHEMATICS and G = {HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT} Also E ∩ F = {HHH}, E ∩ G = {TTT}, F ∩ G = {HHT, HTH, THH} 2 1 4 1 7 Therefore P(E) = = , P (F) = = , P(G) = 8 4 8 2 8 1 1 3 and P(E∩F) = , P (E∩ G) = , P(F ∩ G) = 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 7 7 Also P(E) . P (F) = × = , P(E) ⋅ P(G) = × = 4 2 8 4 8 32 1 7 7 and P(F) . P(G) = × = 2 8 16 Thus P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F) P(E ∩ G) ≠ P(E) . P(G) and P(F ∩ G) ≠ P (F) . P(G) Hence, the events (E and F) are independent, and the events (E and G) and (F and G) are dependent. Example 13 Prove that if E and F are independent events, then so are the events E and F′. Solution Since E and F are independent, we have P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F) ....(1) From the venn diagram in Fig 13.3, it is clear that E ∩ F and E ∩ F ′ are mutually exclusive events (E’∩F’) S E and also  E =(E ∩ F) ∪ (E ∩ F ′). F Therefore P(E) = P(E ∩ F) + P(E ∩ F ′) or P (E ∩ F ′) = P(E) − P(E ∩ F) (E∩F’) = P(E) − P(E) . P(F) (E F) (E’∩F) ∩ (by  (1)) Fig 13.3 = P(E) (1−P(F)) = P(E).  P(F ′) Hence,  E and F ′ are independent Reprint 2024-25 PROBABILITY      421 ANote In a similar manner, it can be shown that if the events E and F are independent, then (a) E ′ and F are independent, (b) E ′ and F ′ are independent Example 14 If A and B are two independent events, then the probability of occurrence of at least one of A and B is given by 1– P(A′) P(B′) Solution We have P(at least one of A and B) = P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A) P(B) = P(A) + P(B) [1−P(A)] = P(A)  +  P(B). P(A′) = 1− P(A′) + P(B) P(A′) = 1− P(A′)  [1− P(B)] = 1− P(A′) P (B′) EXERCISE 13.2
