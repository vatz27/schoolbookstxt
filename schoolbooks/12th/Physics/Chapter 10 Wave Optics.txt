Wave Optics Chapter Ten WAVE OPTICS 10.1  INTRODUCTION In 1637 Descartes gave the corpuscular model of light and derived Snell’s law. It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface. The corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction) bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the second medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed by Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of the tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very often attributed to Newton. In 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the wave theory of light – it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in this chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain the phenomena of reflection and refraction; however, it predicted that on refraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the prediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much later confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of light in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the wave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850. The wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of Newton’s authority and also because light could travel through vacuu2m55 2024-25 Physics and it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate from one point to the other. However, when Thomas Young performed his famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established that light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible light was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the wavelength of yellow light is about 0.6 mm. Because of the smallness of the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of typical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately travel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we had discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in which one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called geometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy propagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero. After the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40 years or so, many experiments were carried out involving the interference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only be satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus, around the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed to be very well established. The only major difficulty was that since it was thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how could light waves propagate through vacuum. This was explained when Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light. Maxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of electricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what is known as the wave equation from which he predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves*. From the wave equation, Maxwell could calculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found that the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed of l ight. From this, he propounded that l ight must be an electromagnetic wave. Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are associated with changing electric and magnetic fields; changing electric field produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing magnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The changing electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of electromagnetic waves (or light waves) even in vacuum. In this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the Huygens principle and derive the laws of reflection and refraction. In Sections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference which is based on the principle of superposition. In Section 10.6 we will discuss the phenomenon of diffraction which is based on HuygensFresnel principle. Finally in Section 10.7 we will discuss the phenomenon of polarisation which is based on the fact that the light waves are transverse electromagnetic waves. * Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves around 1855; it was much later (around 1890) that Heinrich Hertz produced radiowaves in the laboratory. J.C. Bose and G. Marconi made practical applications of the Hertzian 256 waves 2024-25 Wave Optics 10.2  HUYGENS PRINCIPLE We would first define a wavefront: when we drop a small stone on a calm pool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact. Every point on the surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a photograph of the surface would show circular rings on which the disturbance is maximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are oscillating in phase because they are at the same distance from the source. Such a locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a wavefront; thus a wavefront is defined as a surface of constant phase. The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the FIGURE 10.1 (a) A diverging spherical source is called the speed of the wave. The energy of the wave travels wave emanating from in a direction perpendicular to the wavefront. a point source. The If we have a point source emitting waves uniformly in all directions, wavefronts are then the locus of points which have the same amplitude and vibrate in spherical. the same phase are spheres and we have what is known as a spherical wave as shown in Fig. 10.1(a). At a large distance from the source, a small portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have what is known as a plane wave [Fig. 10.1(b)]. Now, if we know the shape of the wavefront at t = 0, then Huygens principle allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later time t. Thus, Huygens principle is essentially a geometrical construction, which given the shape of the wafefront at any time allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later time. Let us consider a diverging FIGURE 10.1 (b) At a wave and let F F  represent a portion of the spherical wavefront at t = 0 1 2 large distance from (Fig. 10.2). Now, according to Huygens principle, each point of the the source, a small wavefront is the source of a secondary disturbance and the wavelets portion of the emanating from these points spread out in all directions with the speed spherical wave can of the wave. These wavelets emanating from the wavefront are usually be approximated by a plane wave. referred to as secondary wavelets and if we draw a common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at a later time. FIGURE 10.2 F F  represents the spherical wavefront (with O as 1 2 centre) at t = 0. The envelope of the secondary wavelets emanating from F F  produces the forward moving  wavefront G G . 1 2 1 2 The backwave D D  does not exist. 1 2 257 2024-25 Physics Thus, if we wish to determine the shape of the wavefront at t = t, we draw spheres of radius vt from each point on the spherical wavefront where v represents the speed of the waves in the medium. If we now draw a common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at t = t.  The new wavefront shown as G G  in Fig. 10.2 is again 1 2 spherical with point O as the centre. The above model has one shortcoming: we also have a backwave which is shown as D D  in Fig. 10.2. Huygens argued that the amplitude of the 1 2 secondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the backward direction; by making this adhoc assumption, Huygens could explain the absence of the backwave. However, this adhoc assumption is not satisfactory and the absence of the backwave is really justified from more rigorous wave theory. In a similar manner, we can use Huygens principle to determine the shape of the wavefront for a plane wave propagating through a medium FIGURE 10.3 (Fig. 10.3).

The figure corresponds to v  < v  so that the refracted waves bends towards the 2 1 258 normal. 2024-25 Wave Optics In order to determine the shape of the refracted wavefront, we draw a sphere of radius v t from the point 2 A in the second medium (the speed of the wave in the second medium is v2). Let CE represent a tangent plane drawn from the point C on to the sphere. Then, AE = v t 2 and CE would represent the refracted wavefront.

Further, if  l  and l  denote the 1  2 wavelengths of light in medium 1 and medium 2, respectively and if the distance BC is equal to l  then the distance AE will be equal to l  (because 1  2 if the crest from B has reached C in time t, then the crest from A should have also reached E in time t ); thus, λ1 BC v = = 1 λ2 AE v2 or v1 v = 2 259 λ1 λ (10.7) 2 2024-25 CHRISTIAAN HUYGENS (1629 – 1695) Physics The above equation implies that when a wave gets refracted into a denser medium (v  > v ) the wavelength and the speed of propagation 1 2 decrease but the frequency  n (= v/l) remains the same. 10.3.2  Refraction at a rarer medium We now consider refraction of a plane wave at a rarer medium, i.e., v  > v . Proceeding in an exactly similar manner we can construct a 2 1 refracted wavefront as shown in Fig. 10.5. The angle of refraction will now be greater than angle of incidence; however, we will still have n  sin i = n  sin r . We define an angle i  by the following equation 1 2 c n sin i 2 c = (10.8) n1 Thus, if i = i  then sin r = 1 and r = 90°. Obviously, for i > i , there can c c not be any refracted wave. The angle i is known as the critical angle and c for all angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, we will not have any refracted wave and the wave will undergo what is known as total internal reflection. The phenomenon of total internal reflection and its applications was discussed in Section 9.4. FIGURE 10.5 Refraction of a plane wave incident on a rarer medium for which v  > v . The plane wave bends 2 1 away from the normal. 10.3.3  Reflection of a plane wave by a plane surface We next consider a plane wave AB incident at an angle i on a reflecting surface MN. If v represents the speed of the wave in the medium and if t represents the time taken by the wavefront to advance from the point B to C then the distance BC =  vt In order to construct the reflected wavefront we draw a sphere of radius vt from the point A as shown in Fig. 10.6. Let CE represent the tangent plane drawn from the point C to this sphere. Obviously 260 AE = BC = vt 2024-25 Demonstration of interference, diffraction, refraction, resonance and Doppler effect http://www.falstad.com/ripple/ Wave Optics FIGURE 10.6 Reflection of a plane wave AB by the reflecting surface MN. AB and CE represent incident and reflected wavefronts. If we now consider the triangles EAC and BAC we will find that they are congruent and therefore, the angles i and r (as shown in Fig. 10.6) would be equal. This is the law of reflection. Once we have the laws of reflection and refraction, the behaviour of prisms, lenses, and mirrors can be understood. These phenomena were discussed in detail in Chapter 9 on the basis of rectilinear propagation of light. Here we just describe the behaviour of the wavefronts as they undergo reflection or refraction. In Fig. 10.7(a) we consider a plane wave passing through a thin prism. Clearly, since the speed of light waves is less in glass, the lower portion of the incoming wavefront (which travels through the greatest thickness of glass) will get delayed resulting in a tilt in the emerging wavefront as shown in the figure. In Fig. 10.7(b) we consider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens; the central part of the incident plane wave traverses the thickest portion of the lens and is delayed the most. The emerging wavefront has a depression at the centre and therefore the wavefront becomes spherical and converges to the point F which is known as the focus. In Fig. 10.7(c) a plane wave is incident on a concave mirror and on reflection we have a spherical wave converging to the focal point F. In a similar manner, we can understand refraction and reflection by concave lenses and convex mirrors. From the above discussion it follows that the total time taken from a point on the object to the corresponding point on the image is the same measured along any ray. For example, when a convex lens focusses light to form a real image, although the ray going through the centre traverses a shorter path, but because of the slower speed in glass, the time taken is the same as for rays travelling near the edge of the lens.

Explain why? (b) When light travels from a rarer to a denser medium, the speed decreases. Does the reduction in speed imply a reduction in the energy carried by the light wave? (c) In the wave picture of light, intensity of light is determined by the square of the amplitude of the wave. What determines the intensity of light in the photon picture of light. Solution (a) Reflection and refraction arise through interaction of incident light with the atomic constituents of matter. Atoms may be viewed as oscillators, which take up the frequency of the external agency (light) causing forced oscillations. The frequency of light emitted by a charged oscillator equals its frequency of oscillation. Thus, the frequency of scattered light equals the frequency of incident light. (b) No. Energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the wave, not on the speed of wave propagation. (c) For a given frequency, intensity of light in the photon picture is determined by the number of photons crossing an unit area per unit time. 10.4  COHERENT AND INCOHERENT ADDITION OF WAVES In this section we will discuss the interference pattern produced by the superposition of two waves. You may recall that we had discussed the superposition principle in Chapter 14 of your Class XI textbook. Indeed the entire field of interference is based on the superposition (a) (b) principle according to which at a particular FIGURE 10.8 (a) Two needles oscillating in point in the medium, the resultant phase in water represent two coherent sources. displacement produced by a number of (b) The pattern of displacement of water waves is the vector sum of the displacemolecules at an instant on the surface of water ments produced by each of the waves. showing nodal N (no displacement) and Consider two needles S  and S  moving 1 2 antinodal A (maximum displacement) lines. periodically up and down in an identical fashion in a trough of water [Fig. 10.8(a)]. They produce two water waves, and at a particular point, the phase difference between the displacements produced by each of the waves does not change with time; when this happens the two sources are said to be coherent.  Figure 10.8(b) shows the position of crests (solid circles) and troughs (dashed circles) at a given instant of time. Consider a point P for which 262 S  P = S  P 1 2 2024-25 EXAMPLE 10.1 Wave Optics Since the distances S  P and S  P are equal, waves from S  and S  will 1 2 1 2 take the same time to travel to the point P and waves that emanate from S  and S  in phase will also arrive, at the point P, in phase. 1 2 Thus, if the displacement produced by the source S  at the point P is 1 given by y  = a cos wt 1 then, the displacement produced by the source S  (at the point P) will 2 also be given by y  = a cos wt 2 Thus, the resultant of displacement at P would be given by y = y  + y  = 2 a cos wt 1 2 Since the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude, the resultant intensity will be given by I = 4 I 0 where I  represents the intensity produced by each one of the individual 0 sources; I  is proportional to a2. In fact at any point on the perpendicular 0 bisector of S S , the intensity will be 4I . The two sources are said to 1 2 0 interfere constructively and we have what is referred to as constructive FIGURE 10.9 (a) Constructive interference. We next consider a point Q [Fig. 10.9(a)] interference at a for which point Q for which the S Q –S Q = 2l path difference is 2l. 2 1 (b) Destructive The waves emanating from S will arrive exactly two cycles earlier 1 interference at a than the waves from S  and will again be in phase [Fig. 10.9(a)]. Thus, if 2 point R for which the the displacement produced by  S  is given by path difference is 1 y  = a cos 2.5 l . wt 1 then the displacement produced by  S  will be given by 2 y  = a cos (wt – 4p)  =  a cos wt 2 where we have used the fact that a path difference of 2l corresponds to a phase difference of 4p. The two displacements are once again in phase and the intensity will again be 4 I  giving rise to constructive interference. 0 In the above analysis we have assumed that the distances S Q and S Q 1 2 are much greater than d (which represents the distance between S  and 1 S ) so that although S Q and S Q are not equal, the amplitudes of the 2 1 2 displacement produced by each wave are very nearly the same. We next consider a point R [Fig. 10.9(b)] for which S R – S R = –2.5l 2 1 The waves emanating from S will arrive exactly two and a half cycles 1 later than the waves from S   [Fig. 10.10(b)]. Thus if the displacement 2 FIGURE 10.10 Locus produced by  S  is given by 1 of points for which y  = a cos wt S P – S P is equal to 1 1 2 zero, ±l, ± 2l, ± 3l . then the displacement produced by  S  will be given by 2 y  = a cos (wt + 5p)  = – a cos wt 2 263 2024-25 Physics where we have used the fact that a path difference of 2.5l corresponds to a phase difference of 5p. The two displacements are now out of phase and the two displacements will cancel out to give zero intensity. This is referred to as destructive interference. To summarise: If we have two coherent sources S  and S  vibrating 1 2 in phase, then for an arbitrary point P whenever the path difference, S P  ~ S P =  nl     (n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...) (10.9) 1 2 we will have constructive interference and the resultant intensity will be 4I ; the sign ~ between  S P and S  P represents the difference between 0 1 2 S P and S  P. On the other hand, if the point P is such that the path 1 2 difference, 1 S P  ~ S P = (n+ ) l     (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) (10.10) 1 2 2 we will have destructive interference and the resultant intensity will be zero. Now, for any other arbitrary point G (Fig. 10.10) let the phase difference between the two displacements be f. Thus, if the displacement produced by S  is given by 1 y  = a cos wt 1 then, the displacement produced by S  would be 2 y  = a cos (wt + f ) 2 and the resultant displacement will be given by y = y + y 1 2 = a [cos wt + cos (wt +f )] = 2 a cos (f/2) cos (wt + f/2) The amplitude of the resultant displacement is 2a cos (f/2) and therefore the intensity at that point will be I = 4 I  cos2 (f/2) (10.11) 0 If f = 0, ± 2 p, ± 4 p,… which corresponds to the condition given by Eq. (10.9) we will have constructive interference leading to maximum intensity. On the other hand, if f = ± p, ± 3p, ± 5p … [which corresponds to the condition given by Eq. (10.10)] we will have destructive interference leading to zero intensity. Now if the two sources are coherent (i.e., if the two needles are going up and down regularly) then the phase difference f at any point will not change with time and we will have a stable interference pattern; i.e., the positions of maxima and minima will not change with time. However, if the two needles do not maintain a constant phase difference, then the interference pattern will also change with time and, if the phase difference changes very rapidly with time, the positions of maxima and minima will also vary rapidly with time and we will see a “time-averaged” intensity distribution. When this happens, we will observe an average intensity that will be given by I = 2 I (10.12) 0 264 at all points. 2024-25 Ripple Tank experiments on wave interference http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/legacy/wave-interference Wave Optics When the phase difference between the two vibrating sources changes rapidly with time, we say that the two sources are incoherent and when this happens the intensities just add up. This is indeed what happens when two separate light sources illuminate a wall. 10.5 INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT WAVES AND YOUNG’S EXPERIMENT We will now discuss interference using light waves. If we use two sodium lamps illuminating two pinholes (Fig. 10.11) we will not observe any interference fringes. This is because of the fact that the light wave emitted from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes abrupt phase changes in times of the order of 10–10 seconds. Thus the light waves coming out from two independent sources of light will not have any fixed phase relationship and would be incoherent, when this FIGURE 10.11 If two sodium happens, as discussed in the previous section, the lamps illuminate two pinholes intensities on the screen will add up. S  and S , the intensities will add 1 2 The British physicist Thomas Young used an up and no interference fringes will ingenious technique to “lock” the phases of the waves be observed on the screen. emanating from S  and S . He made two pinholes S 1 2 1 and S  (very close to each other) on an opaque screen [Fig. 10.12(a)]. 2 These were illuminated by another pinholes that was in turn, lit by a bright source. Light waves spread out from S and fall on both S  and S . 1 2 S  and S  then behave like two coherent sources because light waves 1 2 coming out from S  and S  are derived from the same original source 1 2 and any abrupt phase change in S will manifest in exactly similar phase changes in the light coming out from S  and S . Thus, the two sources S 1 2 1 and S  will be locked in phase; i.e., they will be coherent like the two 2 vibrating needle in our water wave example [Fig. 10.8(a)]. The spherical waves emanating from S  and S  will produce 1 2 interference fringes on the screen GG¢, as shown in Fig. 10.12(b). The positions of maximum and minimum intensities can be calculated by using the analysis given in Section 10.4.

He revived the wave theory of light and recognised that interference phenomena provide proof of the wave properties of light. FIGURE 10.13 Computer generated fringe pattern produced by two point source S  and S  on the screen GG¢ (Fig. 10.12); d = 0.025 mm, D = 5 cm 1 2 and l = 5 × 10–5 cm.) (Adopted from OPTICS by A. Ghatak, Tata McGraw Hill Publishing Co. Ltd., New Delhi, 2000.) 10.6  DIFFRACTION If we look clearly at the shadow cast by an opaque object, close to the region of geometrical shadow, there are alternate dark and bright regions just like in interference. This happens due to the phenomenon of diffraction. Diffraction is a general characteristic exhibited by all types of waves, be it sound waves, light waves, water waves or matter waves. Since the wavelength of light is much smaller than the dimensions of most 266 obstacles; we do not encounter diffraction effects of light in everyday 2024-25 THOMAS YOUNG (1773 – 1829) Wave Optics observations. However, the finite resolution of our eye or of optical instruments such as telescopes or microscopes is limited due to the phenomenon of diffraction. Indeed the colours that you see when a CD is viewed is due to diffraction effects. We will now discuss the phenomenon of diffraction. 10.6.1  The single slit In the discussion of Young’s experiment, we stated that a single narrow slit acts as a new source from which light spreads out. Even before Young, early experimenters – including Newton – had noticed that light spreads out from narrow holes and slits. It seems to turn around corners and enter regions where we would expect a shadow. These effects, known as diffraction, can only be properly understood using wave ideas. After all, you are hardly surprised to hear sound waves from someone talking around a corner! When the double slit in Young’s experiment is replaced by a single narrow slit (illuminated by a monochromatic source), a broad pattern with a central bright region is seen. On both sides, there are alternate dark and bright regions, the intensity becoming weaker away from the centre (Fig. 10.15). To understand this, go to Fig. 10.14, which shows a parallel beam of light falling normally on a single slit LN of width a. The diffracted light goes on to meet FIGURE 10.14  The geometry of path a screen. The midpoint of the slit is M. differences for diffraction by a single slit. A straight line through M perpendicular to the slit plane meets the screen at C. We want the intensity at any point P on the screen. As before, straight lines joining P to the different points L,M,N, etc., can be treated as parallel, making an angle q with the normal MC. The basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller parts, and add their contributions at P with the proper phase differences. We are treating different parts of the wavefront at the slit as secondary sources. Because the incoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these sources are in phase. It is observed that the intensity has a central maximum at q = 0 and other secondary maxima at q l (n+1/2) l/a, which go on becoming weaker and weaker with increasing n. The minima (zero intensity) are at q l nl/a, n = ±1, ±2, ±3, .... FIGURE 10.15 Intensity The photograph and intensity pattern corresponding distribution and photograph of to it is shown in Fig. 10.15. fringes due to diffraction There has been prolonged discussion about at single slit. difference between intereference and diffraction among 267 2024-25 Physics scientists since the discovery of these phenomena. In this context, it is interesting to note what Richard Feynman* has said in his famous Feynman Lectures on Physics: No one has ever been able to define the difference between interference and diffraction satisfactorily. It is just a question of usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference between them. The best we can do is, roughly speaking, is to say that when there are only a few sources, say two interfering sources, then the result is usually called interference, but if there is a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is more often used. In the double-slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the screen is actually a superposition of single-slit diffraction from each slit or hole, and the double-slit interference pattern. 10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern It is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself. The equipment needed can be found in most homes –– two razor blades and one clear glass electric bulb preferably with a straight filament. One has to hold the two blades so that the edges are parallel and have a narrow slit in between. This is easily done with the thumb and forefingers (Fig. 10.16). Keep the slit parallel to the filament, right in front of the eye. Use spectacles if you normally do. With slight adjustment of the width of the slit and the parallelism of the edges, the pattern should be seen with its bright and dark bands. Since the position of all the bands (except the central one) depends on wavelength, they will show some colours. Using a filter for red or blue will make the fringes clearer. With both filters available, the wider fringes for red compared to blue FIGURE 10.16 can be seen. Holding two blades to form a single slit. A In this experiment, the filament plays the role of the first slit S in bulb filament viewed Fig. 10.15. The lens of the eye focuses the pattern on the screen (the through this shows retina of the eye). clear diffraction With some effort, one can cut a double slit in an aluminium foil with bands. a blade. The bulb filament can be viewed as before to repeat Young’s experiment. In daytime, there is another suitable bright source subtending a small angle at the eye. This is the reflection of the Sun in any shiny convex surface (e.g., a cycle bell). Do not try direct sunlight – it can damage the eye and will not give fringes anyway as the Sun subtends an angle of (1/2)°. In interference and diffraction, light energy is redistributed. If it reduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another region, producing a bright fringe. There is no gain or loss of energy, which is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy. * Richand Feynman was one of the recipients of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics 268 for his fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics. 2024-25 Wave Optics
