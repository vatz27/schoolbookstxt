Chapter Fourteen SEMICONDUCTOR ELECTRONICS: MATERIALS, DEVICES AND SIMPLE CIRCUITS 14.1  INTRODUCTION Devices in which a controlled flow of electrons can be obtained are the basic building blocks of all the electronic circuits. Before the discovery of transistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called valves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often called plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes – cathode, plate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes). In a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and the controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying the voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the inter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their energy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices the electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one direction). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves. These vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate generally at high voltages (~100 V) and have limited life and low reliability. The seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor electronics goes back to 1930’s when it was realised that some solidstate semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling the number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them. Simple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change the number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply 2024-25 Physics and flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the solid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons were obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an evacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space is required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume low power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability. Even the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer monitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced by Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state electronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices was formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead sulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as detector of radio waves. In the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of semiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like junction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a 3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also be described. 14.2 CLASSIFICATION OF METALS, CONDUCTORS AND SEMICONDUCTORS On the basis of conductivity On the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity (s ) or resistivity (r = 1/s ), the solids are broadly classified as: (i) Metals: They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity). r ~ 10–2 – 10–8 W m s ~ 102 – 108 S m–1 (ii) Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate to metals and insulators. r ~ 10–5 – 106 W m s ~ 105 – 10–6 S m–1 (iii)Insulators: They have high resistivity (or low conductivity). r ~ 1011 – 1019 W m s ~ 10–11 – 10–19 S m–1 The values of r and s given above are indicative of magnitude and could well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity are not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and semiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which will become clear as we go along in this chapter. Our interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which could be: (i) Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge (ii) Compound semiconductors: Examples are: · Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc. · Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc. · Organic polymers:  polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc. Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on 324 elemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic semiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using 2024-25 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits organic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been developed signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymerelectronics and molecular-electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict ourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly elemental semiconductors Si and Ge. The general concepts introduced here for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply to most of the compound semiconductors as well. On the basis of energy bands According to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of any of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when the atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So the outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very close or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion in a solid very different from that in an isolated atom. Inside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two electrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because of this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different energy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called energy bands.  The energy band which includes the energy levels of the valence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the valence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all the valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in the conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the valence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into the conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when it overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is the case with metallic conductors. If there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence band, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons are available in the conduction band. This makes the material an insulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain external energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the valence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band. At the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band where other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the possibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as due to vacancies in the valence band. Let us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing N atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while for Ge it is the fourth orbit (n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost orbit is 4 (2s and 2p electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons in the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of electrons in the outer orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, for the 4N valence electrons there are 8N available energy states. These 8N discrete energy levels can either form a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands depending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box on Band Theory of Solids). At the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge, the energy band of these 8N states is split apart into two which are separated by an energy gap E  (Fig. 14.1). The lower band which is g completely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute 325 zero is the valence band.  The other band consisting of 4N energy states, called the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero. 2024-25 Physics The lowest energy level in the conduction band is shown as E  and C highest energy level in the valence band is shown as E . Above E  and below E V C V there are a large number of closely spaced energy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1. The gap between the top of the  valence band and bottom of the conduction band is called the energy band gap (Energy gap E ). It may be large, small, or zero, g depending upon the material. These different situations, are depicted in Fig. 14.2 and discussed below: Case I: This refers to a situation, as shown in Fig. 14.2(a). One can have a metal either when the conduction band FIGURE 14.1 The energy band positions in a is partially filled and the balanced band semiconductor at 0 K. The upper band, called the is partially empty or when the conduction conduction band, consists of infinitely large number and valance bands overlap. When there of closely spaced energy states. The lower band, is overlap electrons from valence band can called the valence band, consists of closely spaced easily move into the conduction band. completely filled energy states. This situation makes a  large number of electrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is partially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level making conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials is low or the conductivity is high. FIGURE 14.2 Difference between energy bands of (a) metals, 326 (b) insulators and (c) semiconductors. 2024-25 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits Case II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap E  exists g (E  > 3 eV). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore g no electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large that electrons cannot be excited from the valence band  to the conduction band by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators. Case III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small band gap (E  < 3 eV) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room g temperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough energy to cross the energy gap and enter the  conduction band. These electrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band. Hence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the insulators. In this section we have made a broad classification of metals, conductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will learn the conduction process in semiconductors. 14.3  INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR We shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose lattice structure is shown in Fig. 14.3. These structures are called the  diamond-like structures. Each atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbours. We know that Si and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline structure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its four valence electrons with each of its four nearest neighbour atoms, and also to take share of one electron from each such neighbour. These shared electron pairs are referred to as forming a  covalent bond or simply a valence bond. The two shared electrons can be assumed to shuttle back-and-forth between the associated atoms holding them together strongly. Figure 14.4 schematically shows the 2-dimensional representation of Si or Ge FIGURE 14.3 Three-dimensional diastructure shown in Fig. 14.3 which overemphasises the mond-like crystal structure for Carbon, covalent bond. It shows an idealised picture in which no Silicon or Germanium with bonds are broken (all bonds are intact). Such a situation respective lattice spacing a equal arises at low temperatures. As the temperature increases, to 3.56, 5.43 and 5.66 Å. more thermal energy becomes available to these electrons and some of these electrons may break–away (becoming free electrons contributing to conduction). The thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms in the crystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the bond as shown in Fig. 14.5(a). The neighbourhood, from which the free electron (with charge –q) has come out leaves a vacancy with an effective charge (+q). This vacancy with the effective positive electronic charge is called a hole. The hole behaves as an apparent free particle with effective positive charge. In intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free electrons, n is equal to e the number of holes, n .  That is h n  = n  = n (14.1) e h i where n  is called intrinsic carrier concentration. i Semiconductors posses the unique property in which, apart from electrons, the holes also move. Suppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown 327 2024-25 Physics in Fig. 14.5(a). The movement of holes can be visualised as shown in Fig. 14.5(b). An electron from the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to the vacant site 1 (hole). Thus, after such a jump, the hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an electron. Therefore, apparently, the hole has moved from site 1 to site 2. Note that the electron originally set free [Fig. 14.5(a)] is not involved in this process of hole motion. The free electron moves completely independently as conduction electron and gives rise to an electron current, I e under an applied electric field. Remember that the motion of hole is only a convenient way of FIGURE 14.4 Schematic two-dimensional describing the actual motion of bound electrons, representation of Si or Ge structure showing whenever there is an empty bond anywhere in covalent bonds at low temperature (all bonds intact). +4 symbol the crystal. Under the action of an electric field, indicates inner cores of Si or Ge. these holes move towards negative potential giving the hole current, I . The total current, I is h thus the sum of the electron current I  and the e hole current I : h I = I  + I (14.2) e h It may be noted that apart from the process of generation of conduction electrons and holes, a simultaneous process of recombination occurs in which the electrons recombine with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of generation is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The recombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole. (a) (b) FIGURE 14.5 (a) Schematic model of generation of hole at site 1 and conduction electron due to thermal energy at moderate temperatures. (b) Simplified representation of possible thermal motion of a hole. The electron from the lower left hand covalent bond (site 2) goes to the earlier hole site1, leaving a hole at its site indicating an 328 apparent movement of the hole from site 1 to site 2. 2024-25 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits An intrinsic semiconductor will behave like an insulator at T = 0 K as shown in Fig. 14.6(a). It is the thermal energy at higher temperatures (T > 0K), which excites some electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. These thermally excited electrons at T > 0 K, partially occupy the conduction band. Therefore, the energy-band diagram of an intrinsic semiconductor will be as shown in Fig. 14.6(b). Here, FIGURE 14.6 (a)  An intrinsic semiconductor at T = 0 K some electrons are shown in behaves like insulator. (b)  At T > 0 K, four thermally generated the conduction band. These electron-hole pairs. The filled circles ( ) represent electrons have come from the valence and empty circles ( ) represent holes. band leaving equal number of holes there. Example 14.1 C, Si and Ge have same lattice structure. Why is C insulator while Si and Ge intrinsic semiconductors? Solution  The 4 bonding electrons of C, Si or Ge lie, respectively, in the second, third and fourth orbit.  Hence, energy required to take out an electron from these atoms (i.e., ionisation energy E ) will be g least for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free electrons for conduction in Ge and Si are significant but negligibly small for C. 14.4  EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor depends on its temperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As such, no important electronic devices can be developed using these semiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their conductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities. When a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable impurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the semiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as extrinsic semiconductors or impurity semiconductors. The deliberate addition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms are called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor. The dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure semiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original semiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain this is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should be nearly the same. There are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si or Ge: (i) Pentavalent (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous (P), etc. 329 2024-25 EXAMPLE 14.1 Physics (ii) Trivalent (valency 3); like Indium (In), Boron (B), Aluminium (Al), etc. We shall now discuss how the doping changes the number of charge carriers (and hence the conductivity) of semiconductors. Si or Ge belongs to the fourth group in the Periodic table and, therefore, we choose the dopant element from nearby fifth or third group, expecting and taking care that the size of the dopant atom is nearly the same as that of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent and trivalent dopants in Si or Ge give two entirely different types of semiconductors as discussed below. (i)  n-type semiconductor Suppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent element as shown in Fig. 14.7. When an atom of  +5 valency element  occupies the position of an atom in the crystal lattice of Si, four of its electrons bond with the four silicon neighbours while the fifth remains very weakly bound to its parent atom. This is because the four electrons participating in FIGURE 14.7 (a) Pentavalent donor atom (As, Sb, bonding are seen as part of the effective core P, etc.) doped for tetravalent Si or Ge giving n- of the atom by the fifth electron. As a result type semiconductor, and (b) Commonly used the ionisation energy required to set this schematic representation of n-type material electron free is very small and even at room which shows only the fixed cores of the substituent donors with one additional effective temperature it will be free to move in the positive charge and its associated extra electron. lattice of the semiconductor. For example, the energy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium, and 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this electron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump the forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for silicon) at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor.  Thus, the pentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and hence is known as donor impurity. The number of electrons made available for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the doping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature. On the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number of holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature. In a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons n  is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated e intrinsically, while the total number of holes n  is only due to the holes h from the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would increase due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the number of holes would get reduced further. Thus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons 330 can be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic 2024-25 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits semiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons become the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers. These semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-type semiconductors. For n-type semiconductors, we have, n  >> n (14.3) e h (ii)  p-type semiconductor This is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity like Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than Si or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with neighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to offer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth neighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as shown in Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice wants an electron in place of a hole, an electron  in the outer orbit of an atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this vacancy, leaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole is available for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom becomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth electron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom of p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge along with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is obvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are in addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source of conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for such a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons are minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped FIGURE 14.8 (a) Trivalent with trivalent impurity are called p-type semiconductors. For acceptor atom (In, Al, B etc.) p-type semiconductors, the recombination process will reduce doped in tetravalent Si or Ge the number (n )of intrinsically generated electrons to n . lattice giving p-type semiconi e ductor. (b) Commonly used We have, for p-type semiconductors schematic representation of n  >> n (14.4) h e p-type material which shows Note that the crystal maintains an overall charge neutrality only the fixed core of the substituent acceptor with as the charge of additional charge carriers is just equal and one effective additional opposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice. negative charge and its In extrinsic semiconductors, because of the abundance of associated hole. majority current carriers, the minority carriers produced thermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and thus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of current carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly helps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers. The semiconductor’s energy band structure is affected by doping. In the case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor impurities (E ) and acceptor impurities (E ) also exist. In the energy band D A diagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level E  is slightly D below the bottom EC of the conduction band and electrons from this level move into the conduction band with very small supply of energy. At room temperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (~1012) atoms of Si get ionised.  So the conduction band will have most electrons coming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly, 331 2024-25 Physics for p-type semiconductor, the acceptor energy level E  is slightly above A the top E  of the valence band as shown in Fig. 14.9(b). With very small V supply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level E  and ionise the acceptor negatively. (Alternately, we can also say that A with very small supply of energy the hole from level E  sinks down into A the valence band. Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain external energy.) At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get ionised leaving holes in the valence band. Thus at room temperature the density of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in the extrinsic semiconductor. The electron and hole concentration in a semiconductor in thermal equilibrium is given by n n  = n 2 (14.5) e h i Though the above description is grossly approximate and hypothetical, it helps in understanding the difference between metals, insulators and semiconductors (extrinsic and intrinsic) in a simple manner. The difference in the resistivity of C, Si and Ge depends upon the energy gap between their conduction and valence bands. For C (diamond), Si and Ge, the energy gaps are 5.4 eV, 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV, respectively. Sn also is a group IV element but it is a metal because the energy gap in its case  is 0 eV.

We will now try to understand how a junction is formed and how the junction behaves under the influence of external applied voltage (also called bias). 14.5.1  p-n junction formation Consider a thin p-type silicon (p-Si) semiconductor wafer. By adding precisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer can be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a semiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and n-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region. Two important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction: diffusion and drift. We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more compared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration of electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the concentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side to n-side (p ® n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n ® p). This motion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction. When an electron diffuses from n ® p, it leaves behind an ionised donor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is bonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse from n ® p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on n-side of the junction is developed. Similarly, when a hole diffuses from p ® n due to the concentration gradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is immobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or negative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed. This space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known as depletion region as the electrons and holes  taking part in the initial movement across the junction depleted the region of its free charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness of depletion region is of the order of one-tenth of a micrometre. Due to the positive space-charge region on n-side of the junction and negative space charge region on p-side of the junction, an electric field directed from positive charge towards negative charge develops. Due to this field, an electron on p-side of the junction moves to n-side and a hole on n-side of the junction moves to p- FIGURE 14.10 p-n junction side. The motion of charge carriers due to the electric field formation process. is called drift.  Thus a drift current, which is opposite in direction to the diffusion current (Fig. 14.10) starts. 333 2024-25 Formation and working of p-n junction diode http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/pnjun.html Physics Initially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small. As the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions on either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric field strength  and hence drift current. This process continues until the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n junction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there is no net current. The loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of electron by the p-region causes a  difference of potential across the junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is such as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of equilibrium exists. Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at equilibrium and the potential across the junction. The n-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired electrons. The n material is thus positive relative to the p FIGURE 14.11 (a) Diode under material. Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of equilibrium (V = 0), (b) Barrier electron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a potential under no bias. barrier potential. Example 14.3  Can we take one slab of p-type semiconductor and physically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction? Solution  No! Any slab, howsoever flat, will have roughness much larger than the inter-atomic crystal spacing (~2 to 3 Å) and hence continuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible. The junction will behave as a discontinuity for the flowing charge carriers. 14.6  SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE A semiconductor diode [Fig. 14.12(a)] is basically a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for the application of an external voltage. It is a two terminal device. A p-n junction diode is symbolically represented as shown in Fig. 14.12(b). The direction of arrow indicates the conventional direction of current (when the diode is under forward p n bias). The equilibrium barrier potential can be altered by applying an external voltage V across the diode. The FIGURE 14.12 (a) Semiconductor diode, situation of p-n junction diode under equilibrium (b) Symbol for p-n junction diode. (without bias) is shown in Fig. 14.11(a) and (b). 14.6.1  p-n junction diode under forward bias When an external voltage V is applied across a semiconductor diode such that p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and n-side to the negative terminal [Fig. 14.13(a)], it is said to be forward biased. The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the voltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible. (This is because the resistance of the depletion region – a region where there are no charges – is very high compared to the resistance of  n-side 334 and p-side.) The direction of the applied voltage (V ) is opposite to the 2024-25 EXAMPLE 14.3 Semiconductor Electronics: Materials, Devices and Simple Circuits built-in potential V0. As a result, the depletion layer width decreases and the barrier height is reduced [Fig. 14.13(b)]. The effective barrier height under forward bias is (V0 – V ). If the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be reduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a small number of carriers in the material—those that happen to be in the uppermost energy levels—will possess enough energy to cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase the applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced and more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus the current increases. Due to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the depletion region and reach p-side (where they are minority carries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach the n-side (where they are minority carries). This process under forward bias is known as minority carrier injection. At the junction boundary, on each side, the minority carrier FIGURE 14.13 (a) p-n concentration increases significantly compared to the locations junction diode under forward far from the junction. bias, (b) Barrier potential Due to this concentration gradient, the injected electrons on (1) without battery, (2) Low battery voltage, and (3) High p-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end voltage battery. of p-side. Likewise, the injected holes on n-side diffuse from the junction edge of n-side to the other end of n-side (Fig. 14.14). This motion of charged carriers on either side gives rise to current. The total diode forward current is sum of hole diffusion current and conventional current due to electron diffusion. The magnitude of this current is usually in mA. 14.6.2  p-n junction diode under reverse bias When an external voltage (V ) is applied across the diode such FIGURE 14.14 Forward bias that n-side is positive and p-side is negative, it is said to be minority carrier injection. reverse biased [Fig.14.15(a)]. The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same as the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases and the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field. The effective barrier height under reverse bias is (V0 + V ), [Fig. 14.15(b)]. This suppresses the flow of electrons from n ® p and holes from p ® n. Thus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode under forward bias. The electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on p-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the junction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers gives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few mA. This is quite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority side to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also there under forward bias but it is negligible (mA) when compared with current due to injected carriers which is usually in mA. The diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied voltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers from one side of the junction to the other side of the junction. The current 335 2024-25 Physics is not limited by the magnitude of the applied voltage but is limited due to the concentration of the minority carrier on either side of the junction. The current under reverse bias is essentially voltage independent upto a critical reverse bias voltage, known as breakdown voltage (V ). When V = V , the diode reverse current br br increases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes large change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by an external circuit below the rated value (specified by the manufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed. Once it exceeds the rated value, the diode gets destroyed due to overheating. This can happen even for the diode under forward bias, if the forward current exceeds the rated value. The circuit arrangement for studying the V-I characteristics of a diode, (i.e., the variation of current as a function of applied FIGURE 14.15 (a) Diode voltage) are shown in Fig. 14.16(a) and (b). The battery is connected under reverse bias, (b) Barrier potential under to the diode through a potentiometer (or reheostat) so that the reverse bias. applied voltage to the diode can be changed. For different values of voltages, the value of the current is noted. A graph between V and I is obtained as in Fig. 14.16(c). Note that in forward bias measurement, we use a milliammeter since the expected current is large (as explained in the earlier section) while a micrometer is used in reverse bias to measure the current. You can see in Fig. 14.16(c) that in forward FIGURE 14.16 Experimental circuit arrangement for studying V-I characteristics of a p-n junction diode (a) in forward bias, (b) in reverse bias.

After the characteristic voltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for a very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the threshold voltage or cut-in voltage (~0.2V for germanium diode and ~0.7 V for silicon diode). For the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (~mA) and almost remains constant with change in bias. It is called reverse saturation current. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down voltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode is discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not used beyond the reverse saturation current region. The above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly allows the flow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward bias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This property is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next section. For diodes, we define a quantity called dynamic resistance as the ratio of small change in voltage DV to a small change in current DI: ∆V rd = ∆ (14.6) I Example 14.4 The V-I characteristic of a silicon diode is shown in the Fig. 14.17.

So if an alternating voltage is applied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle when the diode is forward biased. This property is used to rectify alternating voltages and the circuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier. If an alternating voltage is applied across a diode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will appear across the load only during the half cycles of the ac input during which the diode is forward biased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in Fig. 14.18, is called a half-wave rectifier. The secondary of a transformer supplies the desired ac voltage across terminals A and B. When the voltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased and it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is reverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse saturation current of a diode is negligible and can be considered equal to zero for practical purposes. (The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must be sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at the secondary of the transformer to protect the diode from reverse breakdown.) Therefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there FIGURE 14.18 (a) Half-wave rectifier is a current through the load resistor R  and we circuit, (b) Input ac voltage and output L get an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18(b), voltage waveforms from the rectifier circuit. whereas there is no current in the negative halfcycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get the output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is restricted to only one direction and is said to be rectified. Since the rectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is called as half-wave rectifier. The circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output rectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative half of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the p-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the transformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together and the output is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint of the secondary of the transformer. So for a full-wave rectifier the secondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it is called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen from Fig.14.19(c) the voltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage. Each diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate cycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centretap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. (Note that there is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a centre338 tap transformer but needs four diodes.) Suppose the input voltage to A 2024-25
