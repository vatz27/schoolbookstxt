Similarly, a long battle had to be fought with court cases to make cigarette- manufacturing companies accept that their product could cause cancer. Hence, there is a need for rules and regulations to ensure protection for consumers. LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1. What are the various ways by which people may be exploited in the market? 2. Think of one example from your experience where you thought that there was some ‘cheating’ in the market. Discuss in the classroom. 3.

CONSUMER RIGHTS 77 2024-25 Consumers International In 1985 United Nations adopted the UN Guidelines for Consumer Protection. This was a tool for nations to adopt measures to protect consumers and for consumer advocacy groups to press their governments to do so. At the international level, this has become the foundation for consumer movement. Today, Consumers International has become an umbrella body to over 200 member organisations from over 100 countries. Because of all these efforts, the movement succeeded in bringing pressure on business firms as well as government to correct business conduct which may be unfair and against the interests of consumers at large. A major step taken in 1986 by the Indian government was the enactment of the Consumer Protection Act 1986, popularly known as COPRA. You will learn more about COPRA later. LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1. What could have been the steps taken by consumer groups? 2. There may be rules and regulations but they are often not followed. Why?

Amritha, an engineering graduate after submitting all the certificates and attending the interview for a job in a government department, did not receive any news of the result.

She was  not only informed about the reasons for delay in the declaration of results but also got her call letter for appointment as she performed well in the interview. 80 UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 2024-25 LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1.

LEARNING TO BECOME WELL-INFORMED CONSUMERS When we as consumers become conscious of our rights, while purchasing various goods and services, we will be able to distinguish and make informed choices. This 84 UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 2024-25 calls for acquiring the knowledge and skill to become a well-informed consumer. How do we become conscious of our rights? Look at the posters on the right and in the previous page. What do you think? The enactment of COPRA has led to the setting up of separate Departments of Consumer Affairs in central and state governments. The posters that you have seen are one example through which government spread information about legal process which people can use. You might also be seeing such advertisements on television channels. ISI and Agmark While buying many commodities, on the cover, you might have seen a logo with the letters ISI, Agmark, Hallmark or +F. These logos and certification help consumers get assured of quality while purchasing the goods and services. The organisations that monitor and issue these certificates allow producers to use their logos provided they follow certain quality standards. Though these organisations develop quality standards for many products, it is not compulsory for all the producers to follow standards. However, for some products that affect the health and safety of consumers or of products of mass consumption like LPG cylinders, food colours and additives, cement, packaged drinking water, it is mandatory on the part of the producers to get certified by these organisations. 2024-25 LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1.
