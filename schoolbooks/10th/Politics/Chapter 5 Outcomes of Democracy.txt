Outcomes of Democracy Overview As we begin to wind up our tour of democracy, it is time to move beyond our discussion of specific themes and ask a general set of questions: What does democracy do? Or, what outcomes can we reasonably expect of democracy? Also, does democracy fulfil these expectations in real life? We begin by thinking about how to assess the outcomes of democracy. After some clarity on how to think on this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes of democracy in various respects: quality of government, economic well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict and finally freedom and dignity. 2024-25 63 Chapter 5.indd   63 4/29/2022   4:57:46 PM Chapter 5 O u t c o m e s  o f  D e m o c r a c y How do we assess democracy’s outcomes? Do you remember how students principle, but felt to be not so good in in Madam Lyngdoh’s class argued its practice. This dilemma invites us about democracy? This was in to think hard about the outcomes of Chapter 2 of Class IX textbook. democracy. Do we prefer democracy It emerged from that conversation only for moral reasons? Or are there that democracy is a better form of some prudential reasons to support government when compared with democracy too? dictatorship or any other alternative. Did we Over a hundred countries of We felt that democracy was better reach these the world today claim and practice because it: conclusions some kind of democratic politics:  Promotes equality among in Madam they have formal constitutions, they citizens; Lyngdoh’s class? hold elections, they have parties and  Enhances the dignity of the I loved that they guarantee rights of citizens. individual; class because While these features are common to students were  Improves the quality of most of them, these democracies are not being decision-making; very much different from each other dictated any  Provides a method to resolve in terms of their social situations, conclusions. conflicts; and their economic achievements and  Allows room to correct mistakes. their cultures. Clearly, what may be Are these expectations realised achieved or not achieved under each under democracies? When we talk of these democracies will be very to people around us, most of them different. But is there something that support democracy against other we can expect from every democracy, alternatives, such as rule by a monarch just because it is democracy? or military or religious leaders. But Our interest in and fascination not so many of them would be for democracy often pushes us into satisfied with the democracy in taking a position that democracy practice. So we face a dilemma: can address all socio-economic and democracy is seen to be good in political problems. If some of our expectations are not met, we start blaming the idea of democracy. Or, we start doubting if we are living in a democracy. The first step towards thinking carefully about the outcomes of democracy is to recognise that democracy is just a form of government. It can only create conditions for achieving something. The citizens have to take advantage of those conditions and achieve those goals. Let us examine some of the things we can reasonably expect Is democracy all about coping with multiple pressures and from democracy and examine the accommodating diverse demands? record of democracy. 64 2024-25 Chapter 5.indd   64 08-04-2022   12:36:51 D e m o c ra t i c  Po l i t i c s © RK Laxman - Brushing up the years Accountable, responsive and legitimate government There are some things that democracy Governmental Secrecy must provide. In a democracy, we are most concerned with ensuring that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision making, that affects them all. Therefore, the most basic outcome of democracy should be that it produces a government that is accountable to the citizens, and responsive to the needs and expectations of the citizens. Before we go into this question, Now look at the other side – we face another common question: Is democracy ensures that decision making will be based on norms and Can you think of the democratic government efficient? what and how the Is it effective? Some people think that procedures. So, a citizen who wants government knows democracy produces less effective to know if a decision was taken about you and your through the correct procedures family (for example government.

O u t c o m e s  o f  D e m o c r a c y Economic outcomes of democracy Arguments about democracy tend to be very passionate. This is how it should Poor Kids be, for democracy appeals to some of our deep values. These debates cannot be resolved in a simple manner. But some debates about democracy can and should be resolved by referring to some facts and figures. The debate about the economic outcomes of democracy is one such debate. Over the years, many students of democracy have gathered careful evidence to see what the relationship of democracy with economic growth and economic inequalities is. The tables and the cartoon here present some of the evidences:  Table 1 shows that on an average dictatorial regimes have had a slightly better record of economic growth. But when we compare their record only in poor countries, there is virtually no difference.  Table 2 shows that within democracies there can be very high degree of inequalities. In democratic countries like South Africa and Brazil, the top 20 per cent people take away more than 60 per cent of the national income, leaving less than 3 per cent for the bottom 20 per cent population. Countries like Denmark and Hungary are much better in this respect.  You can see in the cartoon, there is often inequality of opportunities available to the poorer sections. What would be your verdict on democracy if you had to base it purely on economic performance of democratic regimes in terms of growth and equal distribution?

In actual life, democracies do not appear to be very successful in reducing economic inequalities. In Class IX Economics textbook, you have already studied about poverty in India. The poor constitute a large proportion of our voters and no party will like to lose their votes. Yet democratically elected governments do not appear to be as keen to address the question of poverty as you would expect them to. The situation is much worse in some other countries. In Bangladesh, more than half of its population lives in poverty. People in several poor countries are now dependent on the rich countries even for food supplies. 2024-25 69 Chapter 5.indd   69 08-04-2022   12:36:55 © Ares - Best of Latin America, Cagle Cartoons Inc.

Read the passage below: Nannu is a daily wage earner. He lives in Welcome Mazdoor Colony, a slum habitation in East Delhi. He lost his ration card and applied for a duplicate one in January 2004. He made several rounds to the local Food and Civil Supplies office for the next three months. But the clerks and officials would not even look at him, leave alone do his job or bother to tell him the status of his application. Ultimately, he filed an application under the Right to Information Act asking for the daily progress made on his application, names of the officials, who were supposed to act on his application and what action would be taken against these officials for their inaction. Within a week of filing application under the Right to Information Act, he was visited by an inspector from the Food Department, who informed him that the card had been made and he could collect it from the office. When Nannu went to collect his card next day, he was given a very warm treatment by the Food and Supply Officer (FSO), who is the head of a Circle. The FSO offered him tea and requested him to withdraw his application under the Right to Information, since his work had already been done. What does Nannu’s example show? What impact did Nannu’s action have on officials? Ask your parents their experiences when they approach government officials to attend to their problems.
