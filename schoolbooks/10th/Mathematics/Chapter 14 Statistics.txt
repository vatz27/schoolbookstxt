STATISTICS 171 STATISTICS 13 13.1 Introduction In Class IX, you have studied the classification of given data into ungrouped as well as grouped frequency distributions. You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central tendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of grouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called ogives. 13.2 Mean of Grouped Data The mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if x , x ,. . ., x  are observations with respective frequencies f , f , . . ., f , then this 1 2 n 1 2 n means observation x  occurs f  times, x  occurs f  times, and so on. 1 1 2 2 Now, the sum of the values of all the observations = f x  + f x  + . . . + f x ,  and 1 1 2 2 n n the number of observations = f  + f  + . . . + f . 1 2 n So, the mean x  of the data is given by f x 1x1  f2x2   fn xn = f1  f2   fn Recall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter  (capital sigma) which means summation. That is, 2024-25 172 MATHEMATICS n  fi xi x  = i1 n  fi i1  f x which, more briefly, is written as x  = i i , if it is understood that i varies from  f 1 to n. i Let us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example. Example 1 : The marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a Mathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below. Find the mean of the marks obtained by the students. Marks obtained 10 20 36 40 50 56 60 70 72 80 88 92 95 (xi) Number of 1 1 3 4 3 2 4 4 1 1 2 3 1 students ( fi) Solution: Recall that to find the mean marks, we require the product of each x  with i the corresponding frequency f . So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1. i Table 13.1 Marks obtained (x ) Number of students ( f ) f x i i i i 10 1 10 20 1 20 . 36 3 108 40 4 160 50 3 150 56 2 112 60 4 240 70 4 280 72 1 72 80 1 80 88 2 176 92 3 276 95 1 95 Total f  = 30 f x  = 1779 i i i 2024-25 STATISTICS 173  f 1779 i xi Now,  x   =  = 59.3  f 30 i Therefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3. In most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean. Let us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the classinterval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped frequency distribution table (see Table 13.2). Table 13.2 Class interval 10 - 25 25 - 40 40 - 55 55 - 70 70 - 85 85 - 100 Number of students 2 3 7 6 6 6 Now, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the representative of the whole class. It is assumed that the frequency of each classinterval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we find the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and lower limits. That is, Upper class limit + Lower class limit Class mark = 2 10 + 25 With reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is , i.e., 2 17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put them in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our x ’s. Now, in general, for the ith i class interval, we have the frequency f  corresponding to the class mark x . We can i i now proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1. 2024-25 174 MATHEMATICS Table 13.3 Class interval Number of students ( f ) Class mark (x ) f x i i i i 10 - 25 2 17.5 35.0 25 - 40 3 32.5 97.5 40 - 55 7 47.5 332.5 55 - 70 6 62.5 375.0 70 - 85 6 77.5 465.0 85 - 100 6 92.5 555.0 Total Σ f  = 30 Σ f x  = 1860.0 i i i The sum of the values in the last column gives us Σ f x . So, the mean x  of the i i given data is given by Σf x i i 1860.0 x  = = = 62 Σ f 30 i This new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method. We observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the same formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different. Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact mean, while 62 an approximate mean. Sometimes when the numerical values of x  and f  are large, finding the product i i of x  and f  becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of i i a method of reducing these calculations. We can do nothing with the f ’s, but we can change each x  to a smaller number i i so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a fixed number from each of these x ’s? Let us try this method. i The first step is to choose one among the x’s as the assumed mean, and denote i it by ‘a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘a’ to be that x i which lies in the centre of x , x , . . ., x . So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let 1 2 n us choose a = 47.5. The next step is to find the difference d  between a and each of the x ’s, that is, i i the deviation of ‘a’ from each of the x ’s. i i.e., d  = x  – a = x  – 47.5 i i i 2024-25 STATISTICS 175 The third step is to find the product of d  with the corresponding f , and take the sum i i of all the f d ’s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4. i i Table 13.4 Class interval Number of Class mark d = x – 47.5 f d i i i i students ( f )  (x ) i i 10 - 25 2 17.5 –30 –60 25 - 40 3 32.5 –15 –45 40 - 55 7 47.5 0 0 55 - 70 6 62.5 15 90 70 - 85 6 77.5 30 180 85 - 100 6 92.5 45 270 Total Σf  = 30 Σf d  = 435 i i i Σfidi So, from Table 13.4, the mean of the deviations, d  = . Σfi Now, let us find the relation between d  and x . Since in obtaining d , we subtracted ‘a’ from each x , so, in order to get the mean i i x , we need to add ‘a’ to d . This can be explained mathematically as: Σfid Mean of deviations, d i = Σfi Σfi (xi − a) So, d  = Σfi Σfi xi Σfia = − Σfi Σfi Σfi = x − a Σfi = x − a So, x  = a + d Σfidi i.e., x  = a + Σfi 2024-25 176 MATHEMATICS Substituting the values of a, Σf d  and Σf  from Table 13.4, we get i i i 435 x  = 47.5 + = 47.5 + 14.5 = 62 . 30 Therefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62. The method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method. Activity 1 : From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of x  (i.e., 17.5, 32.5, i and so on) as ‘a’. What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in each case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?) So, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the choice of ‘a’. Observe that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if we divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to multiply with f . (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.) i xi − a So, let u  = , where a is the assumed mean and h is the class size. i h Now, we calculate u  in this way and continue as before (i.e., find f u and i i i then Σ f u ). Taking h = 15, let us form Table 13.5. i i Table 13.5 xi – a Class interval f x d  = x  – a u  = f u i i i i i h i i 10 - 25 2 17.5 –30 –2 –4 25 - 40 3 32.5 –15 –1 –3 40 - 55 7 47.5 0 0 0 55 - 70 6 62.5 15 1 6 70 - 85 6 77.5 30 2 12 85 - 100 6 92.5 45 3 18 Total Σf  = 30 Σf u  = 29 i i i Σfiu Let u i = Σfi Here, again let us find the relation between u  and x . 2024-25 STATISTICS 177 x We have, u  = i  a i h  (xi  a) fi h 1 f x  af  Therefore, u  =  i i i fi h   f  i  1 fi xi f  i  = a h  fi f i  1 = x  a h So, hu  = x  a i.e., x  = a + hu   f u a i  So, x  i = h    fi  Now, substituting the values of a, h,  f u  and f  from Table 14.5,  we get i i i  29  x  = 47.5  15    30  = 47.5 + 14.5 = 62 So, the mean marks obtained by a student is 62. The method discussed above is called the Step-deviation method. We note that :  the step-deviation method will be convenient to apply if all the d ’s have a i common factor.  The mean obtained by all the three methods is the same.  The assumed mean method and step-deviation method are just simplified forms of the direct method.  The formula x  = a + hu  still holds if a and h are not as given above, but are x  a any non-zero numbers such that u  = i . i h Let us apply these methods in another example. 2024-25 178 MATHEMATICS Example 2 : The table below gives the percentage distribution of female teachers in the primary schools of rural areas of various states and union territories (U.T.) of India.

Remark : The result obtained by all the three methods is the same. So the choice of method to be used depends on the numerical values of x  and f . If x  and f  are i i i i sufficiently small, then the direct method is an appropriate choice. If x  and f  are i i numerically large numbers, then we can go for the assumed mean method or step-deviation method. If the class sizes are unequal, and x  are large numerically, we i can still apply the step-deviation method by taking h to be a suitable divisor of all the d ’s. i 2024-25 180 MATHEMATICS Example 3 : The distribution below shows the number of wickets taken by bowlers in one-day cricket matches.

Further, we discussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining a mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same maximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal.  Though grouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a single mode only. Let us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following example. Example 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows: 2 6 4 5 0 2 1 3 2 3 Find the mode of the data. Solution : Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows: Number of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 wickets Number of 1 1 3 2 1 1 1 matches 2024-25 184 MATHEMATICS Clearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number (i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2. In a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by looking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum frequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is given by the formula:  f  f  Mode = l   1 0  1 0    h 2 f  f f2  where l = lower limit of the modal class, h = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal), f  = frequency of the modal class, 1 f  = frequency of the class preceding the modal class, 0 f  = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class. 2 Let us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula. Example 5 : A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students resulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a household: Family size 1 - 3 3 - 5 5 - 7 7 - 9 9 - 11 Number of 7 8 2 2 1 families Find the mode of this data. Solution : Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this frequency is 3 – 5. So, the modal class is 3 – 5. Now modal class = 3 – 5, lower limit (l ) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2 frequency ( f ) of the modal class = 8, 1 frequency ( f ) of class preceding the modal class = 7, 0 frequency ( f ) of class succeeding the modal class = 2. 2 Now, let us substitute these values in the formula : 2024-25 STATISTICS 185  f  f  Mode = l   1 0  1 0    h 2 f  f f2    8  7  =  2 3    2 3   3.286  2  8  7  2  7 Therefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286. Example 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are given in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and interpret the mode and the mean. Solution : Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students (i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore, the lower limit ( l ) of the modal class = 40, the class size ( h) = 15, the frequency ( f ) of modal class = 7, 1 the frequency ( f ) of the class preceding the modal class = 3, 0 the frequency ( f ) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6. 2 Now, using the formula:  f  f  Mode = l   1 0 ,  1 0    h 2 f  f f2    7  3  we get Mode = 40   = 5    15  2 14 6 3  So, the mode marks is 52. Now, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62. So, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a student obtained 62 marks. Remarks : 1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may be equal or more than the mean also. 2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the average marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most 2024-25 186 MATHEMATICS of the students. In the first situation, the mean is required and in the second situation, the mode is required. Activity 3 : Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations assigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data. They should also compare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both. Remark : The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes. However, we shall not be discussing it. EXERCISE 13.2 1.
