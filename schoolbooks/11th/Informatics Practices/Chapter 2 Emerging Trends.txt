While at home she decided to put her free time to use. Having an aptitude for painting, she tried her hand at decorating clay pots and bowls with designs. She was excited at the praise showered on her by her friends and acquaintances on her work. She even managed to sell a few pieces of unique hand pottery from her home to people living in and around her colony. Operating from home, she was able to save on rental payments. She gained a lot of popularity by word of mouth publicity as a sole proprietor. She further perfected her skills of painting pottery and created new motifs and designs. All this generated great interest among her customers and provided a boost to the demand for her products. By the end of summer, she found that she had	been	able	to	make	a	profit	of	Rs.	2500	from	her	paltry	investment	in	colours, pottery and drawing sheets. She felt motivated to take up this work as a career. She has, therefore, decided to set up her own artwork business. She can continue running the business on her own as a sole proprietor, but she needs more money for doing business on a larger scale. Her father has suggested that she should form a partnership with her cousin to meet the need for additional funds and for sharing the responsibilities and risks. Side by side, he is of the opinion that it is possible that the business might grow further and may require the formation of a company. She	is	in	a	fix	as	to	what	form	of	business	organisation	she	should	go	in	for? 2.1 introduction Let us start our discussion with If one is planning to start a business sole proprietorship — the simplest form or is interested in expanding an of business organisation, and then move on to analysing more complex existing one, an important decision forms of organisations. relates to the choice of the form of organisation.

Dr.	Pemberton	never	realised the potential of the beverage he created. He gradually sold portions of his business to various partners and, just prior to his death in 1888, sold his remaining interest in Coca-Cola to Asa G. Candler. An Atlantan with great business acumen, Mr. Candler proceeded to buy additional business rights and acquire complete control. On May 1, 1889, Asa Candler published a full-page advertisement in The Atlanta Journal, proclaiming his wholesale and retail drug business as “sole proprietors of Coca-Cola ... Delicious. Refreshing. Exhilarating. Invigorating.” Sole ownership, which Mr. Candler did not actually achieve until 1891, needed an investment	of	$	2,300. It was only in 1892 that Mr. Candler formed a company called The Coca-Cola Corporation.

The written agreement which Price Waterhouse Coopers was a Partnership Firm earlier Price Waterhouse Coopers, one of the world’s top accountancy firms has been created in 1998 by the merger of two companies, Price Waterhouse and Coopers and Lybrand — each with historical roots going back some 150 years to the 19th century Great Britain. In 1850, Samuel Lowell Price set up his accounting business in London. In 1865, he was joined in partnership by William H. Holyland and Edwin Waterhouse. As the firm grew, qualified members of its professional staff were admitted to the partnership. By the late 1800s, Price Waterhouse had gained significant recognition as an accounting firm.
