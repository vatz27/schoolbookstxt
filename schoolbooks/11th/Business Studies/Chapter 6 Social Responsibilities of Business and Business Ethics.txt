He	has	started believing that business people tend to do anything to mint money. He happens to take an interview of Mr. Raman Jhunjhunwala, chairman of a leading truck manufacturing company which is known for its fair dealing with customers, employees, investors as well as other social groups. Through this interview, Mani develops the understanding that it is possible for a business enterprise to be socially responsible	and	ethically	upright	and,	at	the	same	time,	be	highly	profitable.	He then gets busy with studying more about the social responsibility of business and business ethics. 6.1 intRoduction working conditions, honestly paying A business enterprise should do taxes prevention/installing pollution business and earn money in ways that devices in the factory, and sincerely fulfill	the	expectations	of	the	society.	 attending to customer complaints are Every individual living in society has examples of socially desirable practices which improve the image of enterprises certain obligations towards society. and also make them profitable.

The CSR provisions within the Act is applicable to companies with an annual turnover of 1,000 crore and more, or a net worth of Rs. 500 crore and more, or a net	profit	of	Rs.	5	crore	and	more. 1.

Need  for  social  responsibility:  Need for social responsibility of business arises	 both	 because	 of	 firm’s	 interest	 and	 the	 interest	 of	 society.	However, there are arguments both for and against social responsibility. Arguments for social responsibility:	Major	arguments	are:	 (i)	 justification for	 existence	 and	 growth,	 (ii)	 long-term	 interest	 and	 image	 of	 the	 firm, (iii) avoidance of government regulation, (iv) maintenance of orderly society, (v) availability of resources with business, (vi) converting problems into opportunity, (vii) better environment for doing business, and (viii) holding the business responsible for social problems. Arguments against social responsibility: Major arguments against social responsibility	are:	(i)	violation	of	profit	maximisation	objective,	(ii)	burden	on consumers, (iii) lack of social skills and (iv) lack of broad public support. Reality of social responsibility: Reality of social responsibility is that, despite differing arguments relating to social responsibility, business enterprises are	 concerned	with	 social	 responsibility	because	 of	 the	 influence	 of	 certain external forces. These forces are: (i) threat of public regulation, (ii) pressure of labour movement, (iii) impact of consumer consciousness, (vi) development 2024-25 Chapter 6.indd   148 9/2/2022   2:11:37 PM SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF BUSINESS AND BUSINESS ETHICS 149 of social standard for businessmen, (v) development of business education, (vi) relationship between social interest and business interest, and  (vii) development of professional, managerial class. Social  responsibility  towards  different  interest  groups:	 Business enterprises have responsibility towards (i) shareholders or owners, (ii) workers, (iii) consumers and (iv) government and community giving fair return on and safety of investment to shareholders, providing opportunities to workers for meaningful work, supplying right quality and quantity of goods and services to consumers and paying to the government, and protecting natural environment are some of the social responsibilities of business. Business and environment protection: Protection of the environment is a serious issue that confronts managers and decision makers. The environment is	defined	as	the	totality	of	man’s	surroundings	—	both	natural	and	man-made. Pollution — the injection of harmful substances into the environment is, in fact, largely the result of industrial production. Pollution has harmful effects both for human life and the life of other species. Causes of Pollution: Among the various sources of pollutions, industry is a major generator of waste in terms of both its quantity and toxicity. Many business enterprises have been responsible for causing air, water, land and noise pollution. Need  for  pollution  control: Important reasons which make a case for pollution control are: (i) reduction of health hazards, (ii) reduced risk of liability, (iii) cost savings (iv) improved public image, and (v) other social	benefits. Role of business in environmental protection: Each member of society can do something to protect the environment. The business enterprises should, however, take the lead in providing their own solutions to environmental problems. Some of the steps that they can take are: top management commitment,	 clear-out	 policies	 and	 programmes,	 abiding	 by	 government regulations, participation in government programmes, periodical assessment of pollution control programmes, and proper education and training of concerned people. Concept of business ethics: Ethics is concerned with what is right and what is wrong in human behaviour judged on the basis of socially determined standards	 of	 behaviour.	 Business	 ethics	 concerns	 itself	 with	 relationship between objectives, practices, and techniques and the good of society. Ethics is important for every business. Elements of business ethics: An enterprise can foster ethics at the workplace by following basic elements of business ethics, such as (i) top management’s commitment, (ii) publication of a establishment of compliance mechanism, (iv) involving employees at all levels and (v) measuring results. 2024-25 Chapter 6.indd   149 9/2/2022   2:11:37 PM 150 BUSINESS  STUDIES EXERCISES Short Answer Questions 1.
