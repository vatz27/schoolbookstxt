318 Accountancy Financial Statements - II 9 In chapter 8, you learnt about the preparation of simple final accounts in the format of trading and profit and loss account and balance sheet. The L preparation of simple final accounts pre-supposes earning Objectives the absence of any accounting complexities After studying this chapter, which are normal to business operations. These you will be able to : complexities arise due to the fact that the process of •	 describe	 the	 need	 for	 determining income and financial position is based adjustments while preparing	the	financial	 on the accrual basis of accounting.

Also, there may exist incomes and expenses sheet with adjust­ relating to the current year that still need to be m ents. brought into books of account. Such items duly adjusted, the final accounts will not reflect the true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business. 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   318 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM Financial Statements - II 319 For example, an amount of ̀  1,200 paid on July 01, 2016 towards insurance premium. Any general insurance premium paid usually covers a period of 12 months. Suppose the accounting year ends on March 31, 2017, it would mean that one fourth of the insurance premium is paid on July 01, 2016 relate to the next accounting year 2017-18. Therefore, while preparing the financial statements for 2016-17, the expense on insurance premium that should be debited to the profit and loss account is ` 900 (` 1,200 – ` 300). Let us take another example. The salaries for the month of March, 2017 were paid on April 07, 2017. This means that the salaries account of 2016-17 does not include the salaries for the month of March 2017. Such unpaid salaries is termed as salaries outstanding which have to be brought into books of account and is debited to profit and loss account along with the salaries already paid for the month of April, 2016 up to Feburary, 2017. Similarly, adjustments may also become necessary in respect of certain incomes received in advance or those which have accrued but are still to be received. Apart from these, there are certain items which are not recorded on day-to-day basis such as depreciation on fixed assets, interest on capital, etc. These are adjusted at the time of preparing financial statements. The purpose of making various adjustments is to ensure that the final accounts reveal the true profit or loss and the true financial position of the business. The items which usually need adjustments are: 1. Closing stock 2. Outstanding/expenses 3. Prepaid/Unexpired expenses 4. Accrued income 5. Income received in advance 6. Depreciation 7. Bad debts 8. Provision for doubtful debts 9. Provision for discount on debtors 10. Manager’s commission 11. Interest on capital It may be noted that when we prepare the financial statements, we are provided with the trial balance and some other additional information in respect of the adjustments to be made. All adjustments are reflected in the final accounts at two places to complete the double entry. Our earlier example in chapter 8 (Page no. 294) which represents the trial balance of Ankit is reproduced in figure 9.1: 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   319 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM 320 Accountancy Trial Balance of Ankit as on March 31, 2017 Account Title Elements L.F.

Figure 9.1 : Showing the trial balance of Ankit We will now study about the items of adjustments and you will observe how these adjustments are helpful in the preparation  of financial statements in order to reflect the true profit and loss and financial position of the firm. 9.2 Closing Stock As per the example in chapter 9 (Page no. 336), the closing stock represents the cost of unsold goods lying in the stores at the end of the accounting period. The adjustment with regard to the closing stock is done by (i) by crediting it to the trading and profit and loss account, and (ii) by showing it on the asset side of the balance sheet. The adjustment entry to be recorded in this regard is : Closing stock A/c Dr. To Trading A/c The closing stock of the year becomes the opening stock of the next year and is reflected in the trial balance of the next year. The trading and profit 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   320 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM Financial Statements - II 321 and loss account of Ankit for the year ended March 31, 2017 and his balance sheet as on that date shall appear as follows : Trading and Profit and Loss Account of Ankit for the year ended March 31, 2017 Dr. Cr.

In that case, the entry recorded is as follows : Closing stock A/c  Dr. To Purchases A/c This entry reduces the amount in the purchases account and is also known as adjusted purchases which is shown on the debit side of the trading and profit and loss account. In this context,  it may be noted, that the closing stock will not be shown on the credit side of the trading and profit and loss as it has been already been adjusted through the purchases account. Not only, in such a situation, even the opening stock will not be separately reflected in the trading and profit and loss account, as it is also adjusted in purchases by recording the following entry: Purchases A/c  Dr. To Opening stock A/c Another important point to be noted in this context is that when the opening and closing stocks are adjusted through purchases, the trial balance does not show any opening stock. Instead, the closing stock shall appear in the trial balance (not as additional information or as an adjustment item) and so also the adjusted purchases. In such a situation, the adjusted purchases shall be debited to the trading and profit and loss account. 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   321 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM 322 Accountancy The closing stock shall be shown on the assets side of the balance sheet as shown below: Balance Sheet of Ankit as at March 31, 2017 Liabilities  Amount Assets  Amount `   ` Owners funds   Non­Current Assets Capital 12,000  Furniture  15,000 Add  Net profit 19,500 31,500 Current Assets Non­Current Liabilities   Debtors  15,500 Long-term loan  5,000 Bank  5,000 Current Liabilities   Cash  1,000 Creditors  15,000 Closing stock  15,000 51,500   51,500 9.3 Outstanding Expenses It is quite common for a business enterprise to have some unpaid expenses in the normal course of business operations at the end of an accounting year. Such items usually are wages, salaries, interest on loan, etc. When expenses of an accounting period remain unpaid at the end of an accounting period, they are termed as outstanding	expenses. As they relate to the earning of revenue during the current accounting year, it is logical that they should be duly charged against revenue for computation of the correct amount of profit or loss. The entry to bring such expenses into account is : Concerned expense A/c  Dr. To Outstanding expense A/c The above entry opens a new account called Outstanding	Expenses which is shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. The amount of outstanding expenses is added to the total of expenses under a particular head for the purpose of preparing trading and profit and loss account. For example, refer to Ankit’s trial balance (refer figure 10.1). You will notice that wages are shown at ` 8,000. Let us assume that Ankit owes `500 as wages relating to the year 2016-17 to one of his employees. In that case, the correct expense on wages amounts to ` 8,500 instead of ` 8,000. Ankit must show ` 8,500 as expense on account of wages in the trading and profit and loss account and recognise a current liability of ` 500 towards the sum owed to his staff. It will be referred to as wages outstanding and it  will be adjusted to wages account by recording the following journal entry: Wages A/c Dr. 500 To Wages outstanding A/c   500 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   322 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM Financial Statements - II 323 The amount of outstanding wages will be added to wages account for the preparation of the trading and profit and loss account as follows : Trading and Profit and Loss Account of Ankit for the year ended March 31, 2017 Dr. Cr. Expenses/Losses	 	 Amount	 Revenues/Gains	 	 Amount `   ` Purchases  75,000 Sales     1 ,25,000 Wages 8,000 Add Outstanding wages 500  8,500 Closing stock  15,000 Gross profit c/d  56,500 1,40,000   1,40,000 Salaries  25,000 Gross profit b/d  56,500 Rent of building  13,000 Commission received  5,000 Bad debts  4,500 Net profit (transferred to   19,000 Ankit’s capital account) 61,500   61,500 Observe carefully the trading and profit and loss account of Ankit. Did you notice the amount of net profit is reduced to ̀  19,000 on account of outstanding wages. The item relating to outstanding wages will be shown in balance sheet as follows : Balance Sheet of Ankit as at March 31, 2017 Liabilities  Amount Assets  Amount `   ` Owners Funds   Non­Current Assets Capital 12,000  Furniture  15,000 Add Profit 19,000 31,000 Current Assets Non­Current Liabilities   Debtors  15,500 Long-term loan  5,000 Bank  5,000 Current Liabilities   Cash  1,000 Creditors  15,000  Closing stock  15,000 Outstanding wages  500 51,500   51,500 9.4 Prepaid Expenses There are several items of expense which are paid in advance in the normal course of business operations. At the end of the accounting year, it is found that the benefits of such expenses have not yet been fully received; a portion 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   323 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM 324 Accountancy of its benefit would be received in the next accounting year. This portion of expense, is carried forward to the next year and is termed  as prepaid	expenses. The necessary adjustment in respect of prepaid expenses is made by recording the following entry: Prepaid expense A/c Dr. To concerned expense A/c The effect of the above adjustment entry is that the amount of prepaid part is deducted from the total of the particular expense, and the new account of prepaid expense is shown on the assets side of the balance sheet. For example, in Ankit’s trial balance, let us assume that the amount of salary paid by him to the employees includes an amount of ` 5,000 which was paid in advance to one of his employees upon his joining the office. This implies that Ankit has overpaid his staff by ` 5,000 on account of his salary. Hence, correct expense on account of salary  during the current period will be  ` 20,000 instead of ` 25,000. Ankit must show ̀  20,000 expense on account of salary in the profit and loss account and recognise a current asset of ` 5,000 as an advance salary to the employee. It will be termed as prepaid salary account and will be  recorded by  the following journal entry : Prepaid salary A/c Dr. 5,000 To salary A/c   5,000 The account  of prepaid salary will be shown in the trading and profit and loss account as follows: Trading and Profit and Loss Account of Ankit for the year ended March 31, 2017 Dr. Cr.

Such incomes are known as accrued income. The adjusting entry for accrued income is : Accrued income  A/c Dr. To Concerned income A/c The amount of accrued income will be added to the related income in the profit and loss account and the new account of accrued income will appear on the asset side of the balance sheet. Let us, for example, assume that Ankit was giving a little help to a fellow businessman by introducing few parties to him on commission for this service. In the trial balance of Ankit you will notice an item of commission received amounting to ` 5,000. Assume that the commission amounting to `1,500 was still receivable from the fellow businessman. This implies that income from commission earned during 2016-17 is ` 6, 500 (`5, 000 + ` 1,500) Ankit needs to record an adjustment entry to give effect to the accrued commission as follows : Accrued Commission A/c Dr. 1,500 To Commission A/c   1,500 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   325 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM 326 Accountancy The account of accrued income will be recorded in trading and profit and loss account as follows : Trading and Profit and Loss Account of Ankit for the year ended March 31, 2017 Dr. Cr.

Further, it  will be shown in the balance sheet of Ankit on the assets side under the head current asset. Balance Sheet of Ankit as at March 31, 2017 Liabilities  Amount Assets  Amount `    ` Owners Funds   Non­Current Assets Capital 12,000  Furniture  15,000 Add Profit 25,500 37,500 Current Assets Non­Current Liabilities   Debtors  15,500 Long-term loan  5,000 Prepaid salary  5,000 Current Liabilities   Accrued commission  1,500 Creditors  15,000 Bank  5,000 Outstanding wages  500 Cash  1,000 Closing stock  15,000 58,000   58,000 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   326 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM Financial Statements - II 327 9.6 Income Received in Advance Sometimes, a certain income is received but the whole amount of it does not belong to the current period. The portion of the income which belongs to the next accounting period is termed as income received in advance or an Unearned Income. Income received in advance is adjusted by recording the following entry: Concerned income A/c Dr. To Income received in advance A/c The effect of this entry will be that the balance in the income account will be equal to the amount of income earned for the current accounting period, and the new account of income received in advance will be shown as a liability in the balance sheet. For example, let us assume Ankit has agreed in March 31, 2017 to sublet a part of the building to a fellow shopkeeper @ ` 1,000 per month. The person gives him rent in advance for the next three months of April, May and June. The amount received had been credited to the profit and loss account. However, this income does not pertain to current year and hence will not be credited to profit and loss account. It is income received in advance and will be recognised as a liability amounting to ` 3,000. Ankit needs to record an adjustment entry to give effect to income received in advance by way of following journal entry: Rent received A/c Dr. 3,000 To Rent received in advance A/c   3,000 This will lead a new account of rent received in advance of ` 3,000 which will appear as follows : Balance Sheet of Ankit as at March 31, 2017 Liabilities  Amount Assets  Amount `   ` Owners Funds   Non Current Assets Capital 12,000  Furniture  15,000 Add Net profit 25,500 37,500 Current Assets Non Current Liabilities   Debtors  15,500 Long-term loan  5,000 Prepaid salary  5,000 Current Liabilities   Accrued commission  1,500 Creditors  15,000 Bank  5,000 Outstanding wages  500 Cash  4,000 Rent received in advance  3,000 Closing stock  15,000 61,000   61,000 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   327 9/13/2022   5:00:26 PM 328 Accountancy 9.7 Depreciation Recall from chapter 7 (Part-I), that depreciation is the decline in the value of assets on account of wear and tear and  passage of time. It is treated as a business expense and is debited to profit and loss account. This, in effect, amounts to writing-off a portion of the cost of an asset which has been used in the business for the purpose of earning profits. The entry for providing depreciation is : Depreciation A/c Dr. To Concerned asset A/c In the balance sheet, the asset will be shown at cost minus the amount of depreciation. For example, the trial balance in our example shows that Ankit has a furniture account with a balance of ̀  15,000. Let us assume that furniture is subject to a depreciation of 10% per annum. This implies that Ankit must recognise that at the end of the year the value attached to furniture is to be reduced  by ` 1,500 (` 15,000 × 10%). Ankit needs to record an adjustment entry to give effect to depreciation on furniture as follows : Depreciation A/c Dr. 1,500 To Furniture A/c   1,500 Depreciation will be shown in the profit and loss account and balance sheet as follows : Trading and Profit and Loss Account of Ankit for the year ended March 31, 2017 Dr. Cr. Expenses/Losses	 	 Amount	 Revenues/Gains	 	 Amount `   ` Purchases  75,000 Sales     1 ,25,000 Wages 8,000  Closing stock  15,000 Add Outstanding wages  (500)   8,500 Gross Profit c/d  56,500 1,40,000   1,40,000 Salaries 25,000  Gross profit b/d  56,500 Less Prepaid salary (5,000)   20,000 Rent of building  13,000 Commission  received 5,000 6 ,500 Add Accrued 1,500 Depreciation-Furniture  1,500        Commission Bad debts  4,500 Net profit (transferred to    24,000 Ankit’s capital account) 63,000   63,000 Notice that the amount of net profit declines with the adjustment of depreciation. Let us now see how depreciation as an expense will be shown in balance sheet. 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   328 9/13/2022   5:00:27 PM Financial Statements - II 329 Balance Sheet of Ankit as at March 31, 2017 Liabilities  Amount Assets  Amount `   ` Owners Funds   Non­Current Assets Capital 12,000  Furniture 15,000 Add Profit 24,000  36,000 Less Depreciation (1,500)  13,500 Non­Current Liabilities   Current Assets Long-term loan  5,000 Debtors  15,500 Current Liabilities   Prepaid salary  5,000 Creditors  15,000 Accrued commission  1,500 Outstanding wages  500 Bank  5,000 Rent received in advance  3,000 Cash  4,000 Closing stock  15,000 59,500   59,500 9.8 Bad Debts Bad debts refer to the amount that the firm has not been able to realise from its debtors. It is  regarded as a loss and is termed as bad debt. The entry for recording bad debt is: Bad debts A/c Dr. To Debtors A/c You will notice in Ankit’s trial balance, that it contains bad debts amounting to ̀  4,500. Whereas, the sundry debtors of Ankit are reported as ̀  15,500. The existence of bad debts in the trial balance signifies that Ankit has incurred a loss arising out of  bad debts during the year and which has been already recorded in the books of account. However, assuming one of his debtors who owed him ` 2,500 had become insolvent, and nothing is receivable from him. But the amount of bad debts related to the current year is still to be account for. This fact appears as additional information and is termed as further bad debts. The adjustment entry to be recorded for the amount will be as follows. For this purpose, Ankit needs to record an adjustment entry as under : Bad debts A/c Dr. 2,500 To Debtors A/c   2,500 This entry will reduce the value of debtors to ` 13,000( ` 15,500 – ` 2,500) and increases the amount of bad debts to ` 7,000 (` 4,500 + ` 2,500). 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   329 9/13/2022   5:00:27 PM 330 Accountancy The treatment of further bad debts in profit and loss account and balance sheet is shown below : Trading and Profit and Loss Account of Ankit for the year ended  March 31, 2017 Dr. Cr.

It is quite possible that the whole 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   330 9/13/2022   5:00:27 PM Financial Statements - II 331 of this amount may not be realised in future. However, it is not possible to accurately know the amount of such bad debts. Hence, we make a reasonable estimate of such loss and provide the same. Such provision is called  provision for bad debts and  is created by debiting profit and loss account. The following journal entry is recorded in this context : Profit and Loss A/c Dr. To  Provision for doubtful debts A/c Provision for doubtful debts is also shown as a deduction from the debtors on the asset side of the balance sheet. Let us assume, Ankit feels that 5% of his debtors on March 31, 2017 are likely to default on their payments next year. This implies he expects bad debts of ` 650 (` 13,000 × 5%).

The provision for doubtful debts brought forward from the previous year is called the opening provision or old provision.When such a provision already exists, the loss due to bad debts during the current year are adjusted against the same and while making provision for doubtful debts required at the end of the current year is called new provision. The balance of old provision as given in trial balance should also be taken into account. Let us take an example to understand how bad debts and provision for doubtful debts are recorded. An extract from a trial balance on March 31, 2017 is given below : ` Sundry debtors 32,000 Bad debts 2,000 Provision for doubtful debts  3,500 Additional Information : Write-off further bad debts ` 1,000 and create a provision for doubtful debts @ 5% on debtors. 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   332 9/13/2022   5:00:27 PM Financial Statements - II 333 In this case, the following journal entries will be recorded : Debit Credit Date Particulars   L.F.

Discount likely to be allowed to customers in an accounting year 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   333 9/13/2022   5:00:27 PM 334 Accountancy can be estimated and provided for by creating a provision for discount on debtors. Provision for discount is made on good debtors which are arrived at by deducting further bad debts and the provision for doubtful debts. The following journal entry is recorded to create provision for discount on debtors: Profit and loss A/c Dr. To Provision for discount on debtors A/c As stated above, the provision for discount on debtors will be created only on good debtors. It will be calculated on the amount of debtors arrived at after deducting the doubtful debts, i.e. ` 12,350 (` 13,000 – ` 650). Ankit needs to record the adjustment entry as : Profit and loss A/c Dr. 227 To Provision for discount on debtors A/c  227 This will reduce the current year profit by ` 227 on account of probable discount on prompt payment. In the balance sheet, it will be shown as a deduction from the debtors account to portray correctly the expected realiable value of debtors as ` 12,123.

The percentage of the commission is applied on the profit either before charging such commission or after charging such commission. In the absence of any such information, it is assumed that commission is allowed as a percentage of the net profit before charging such commission. Suppose the net profit of a business is  ` 110 before charging commission. If the manager is entitled to 10% of the profit before charging such commission, the commission will be calculated as : = ` 110 ×  = ` 11 2024-25 Ch-09.indd   335 9/13/2022   5:00:27 PM 336 Accountancy In case the commission is 10% of the profit after charging such commission, it will be calculated as : = Profit before commission × Rate of commission/ (100 + commission) The managers commission will be adjusted in the books of account by recording the following entry : Profit and loss A/c Dr. To Manager’s commission A/c Let us recall our example and assume that Ankit’s manager is entitled to a commission @ 10%.
