160 Accountancy Bank Reconciliation Statement 5 In chapter 4, you have learnt that the business organisations keep a record of their cash and bank transactions in a cash book. The cash book also serves the purpose of both the cash account and the bank account and shows the balance of both at the end of the period. Once the cash book has been balanced, it is usual to check its details with the records of the firm’s bank transactions as recorded by the bank. To enable this check, the cashier needs to ensure that the cash book is completely up to date and a recent bank statement (or a bank passbook) has been obtained from the bank. A bank statement or a bank passbook is a copy of a bank account as LEARNING OBJECTIVES shown by the bank records. This enable the bank After studying this customers to check their funds in the bank chapter, you will be able regularly and update their own records of to : transactions that have occurred. An illustrative • state the meaning and bank passbook of a current account is shown in need for the preparation figure 5.1. of bank reconciliation statement; The amount of balance shown in the passbook • identify causes of or the bank statement must tally with the balance difference between as shown in the cash book. But in practice, these bank balance as per are usually found to be different. Hence, we have cash book and pass to ascertain the causes for such difference. It will book; be observed that a bank statement/passbook • prepare the bank shows all deposits in the credit column and reconciliation statement; • ascertain the correct withdrawals in the debit column. Thus, if deposits bank balance as per exceed withdrawals it shows a credit balance and cash book; if withdrawals exceed deposits it will show a debit balance (overdraft). 2024-25 Bank Reconciliation Statement 161 5.1 Need for Reconciliation It is generally experienced that when a comparison is made between the bank balance as shown in the firm’s cash book, the two balances do not tally. Hence, we have to first ascertain the causes of difference thereof and then reflect them in a statement called  Bank Reconciliation Statement to reconcile (tally) the two balances. In order to prepare a bank reconciliation statement we need to have a bank balance as per the cash book and a bank statement as on a particular day along with details of both the books. If the two balances differ, the entries in both the books are compared and the items on account of which the difference has arisen are ascertained with the respective amounts involved so that the bank reconciliation statement may be prepared.

The differences between the cash book and the bank passbook is caused by: • timing differences on recording of the transactions. • errors made by the business or by the bank. 5.1.1 Timing Differences When a business compares the balance of its cash book with the balance shown by the bank passbook, there is often a difference, which is caused by the time gap in recording the transactions relating either to payments or receipts. The factors affecting time gap includes : 5.1.1(a) Cheques issued by the bank but not yet presented for payment When cheques are issued by the firm to suppliers or creditors of the firm, these are immediately entered on the credit side of the cash book. However, the receiving party may not present the cheque to the bank for payment immediately. The bank will debit the firm’s account only when these cheques are actually paid by the bank. Hence,  there is a time lag between the issue of a cheque and its presentation to the bank which may cause the difference between the two balances. 5.1.1(b) Cheques paid into the bank but not yet collected When firm receives cheques from its customers (debtors), they are immediately recorded in the debit side of the cash book. This increases the bank balance as per the cash book. However, the bank credits the customer account only when the amount of cheques are actually realised. The clearing of cheques generally takes few days especially in case of outstation cheques or when the cheques are paid-in at a bank branch other than the one at which the account of the firm is maintained. This leads to a cause of difference between the bank balance shown by the cash book and the balance shown by the bank passbook. 5.1.1(c) Direct debits made by the bank on behalf of the customer Sometimes, the bank deducts amount for various services from the account without the firm’s knowledge. The firm comes to know about it only when the bank statement arrives. Examples of such deductions include: cheque collection charges, incidental charges, interest on overdraft, unpaid cheques deducted by the bank – i.e., stopped or bounced, etc. As a result, the balance as per passbook will be less than the balance as per cash book. 2024-25 164 Accountancy 5.1.1(d) Amounts directly deposited in the bank account There are instances when debtors (customers) directly deposits money into firm’s bank account. But, the firm does not receive the intimation from any source till it receives the bank statement. In this case, the bank records the receipts in the firm’s account at the bank but the same is not recorded in the firm’s cash book. As a result, the balance shown in the bank passbook will be more than the balance shown in the firm’s cash book. 5.1.1(e) Interest and dividends collected by the bank When the bank collects interest and dividend on behalf of the customer, then these are immediately credited to the customers account. But the firm will know about these transactions and record the same in the cash book only when it receives a bank statement. Till then the balances as per the cash book and passbook will differ. 5.1.1(f) Direct payments made by the bank on behalf of the customers Sometimes the customers give standing instructions to the bank to make some payment regularly on stated days to the third parties. For example, telephone bills, insurance premium, rent, taxes, etc. are directly paid by the bank on behalf of the customer and debited to the account. As a result, the balance as per the bank passbook would be less than the one shown in the cash book. 5.1.1(g) Cheques deposited/bills discounted dishonoured If a cheque deposited by the firm is dishonoured or a bill of exchange drawn by the business firm is discounted with the bank is dishonoured on the date of maturity, the same is debited to customer’s account by the bank. As this information is not available to the firm immediately, there will be no entry in the firm’s cash book regarding the above items. This will be known to the firm when it receives a statement  from the bank. As a result, the balance as per the passbook would be less than the cash book balance. 5.1.2 Differences Caused by Errors Sometimes the difference between the two balances may be accounted for by an error on the part of the bank or an error in the cash book of the business. This causes difference between the bank balance shown by the cash book and the balance shown by the bank statement. 2024-25 Bank Reconciliation Statement 165 5.1.2(a) Errors committed in recording transaction by the firm Omission or wrong recording of transactions relating to cheques issued, cheques deposited and wrong totalling, etc., committed by the firm while recording entries in the cash book cause difference between cash book and passbook balance. 5.1.2(b) Errors committed in recording transactions by the bank Omission or wrong recording of transactions relating to cheques deposited and wrong totalling, etc., committed by the bank while posting entries in the passbook also cause differences between passbook and cash book balance. Test Your Understanding - I I. Read the following transactions and identify the cause of difference on the basis of time gap or errors made by business firm/bank. Put a sign (ü ) for the correct cause. S.No. Transactions Time Gap Errors made by business/ bank 1. Cheques issued to customers but not presented for payment. 2.

(vi) If the passbook shows a favourable balance and if it is taken as the starting point for the purpose of bank reconciliation statement then cheques issued but not presented for payment should be .............to find out cash balance. (vii) When the cheques are not presented for payment, favourable balance as per the cash book is .............than that of the passbook. (viii) When a banker collects the bills and credits the account passbook overdraft shows .............balance.

(x) When the passbook balance is taken as the starting point items which makes the passbook balance .............than the balance in the cash book must be deducted for the purpose of reconciliation. 5.2 Preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statement After identifying the causes of difference, the reconciliation may be done in the following two ways: (a) Preparation of bank reconciliation statement without adjusting cash book balance. (b) Preparation of bank reconciliation statement after adjusting cash book balance. It may be noted that in practice, the bank reconciliation statement is prepared after adjusting the cash book balance, about which you will study later in the chapter. 5.2.1 Preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statement without adjusting Cash Book Balance To prepare bank reconciliation statement, under this approach, the balance as per cash book or as per passbook is the starting item. The debit balance as per the cash book means the balance of deposits held at the bank. Such a balance will be a credit balance as per the passbook. Such a balance exists when the deposits made by the firm are more than its withdrawals. It indicates the favourable balance as per cash book or favourable balance as per the passbook. On the other hand, the credit balance as per the cash book indicates bank overdraft. In other words, the excess amount withdrawn over the amount deposited in the bank. It is also known as unfavourable balance as per cash book or unfavourable balance as per passbook. 2024-25 Bank Reconciliation Statement 167 We may have four different situations while preparing the bank reconciliation statement. These are : 1. When debit balance (favourable balance) as per cash book is given and the balance as per passbook is to be ascertained. 2. When credit balance (favourable balance) as per passbook is given and the balance as per cash book is to be ascertained. 3. When credit balance as per cash book (unfavourable balance/overdraft balance) is given and the balance as per passbook is to ascertained. 4. When debit balance as per passbook (unfavourable balance/overdraft balance) is given and the cash book balance as per is to ascertained. 5.2.1(a) Dealing with favourable balances The following steps may be initiated to prepare the bank reconciliation statement: (i) The date on which the statement is prepared is written at the top, as part of the heading. (ii) The first item in the statement is generally the balance as shown by the cash book. Alternatively, the starting point can also be the balance as per passbook. (iii) The cheques deposited but not yet collected are deducted. (iv) All the cheques issued but not yet presented for payment, amounts directly deposited in the bank account are added. (v) All the items of charges such as interest on overdraft, payment by bank on standing instructions and debited by the bank in the passbook but not entered in cash book, bills and cheques dishonoured etc. are deducted. (vi) All the credits given by the bank such as interest on dividends collected, etc. and direct deposits in the bank are added. (vii) Adjustment for errors are made according to the principles of rectification of errors. (The rectification of errors has been discussed in  detail in chapter 6.) (viii) Now the net balance shown by the statement should be same as shown by the passbook. It may be noted that treatment of all items shall be the reverse of the above if we adjust passbook balance as the starting point. (see illustration 3) The following solved illustrations will help you understand dealing with favourable balance as per cash book and passbook. 2024-25 168 Accountancy Illustration 1 From the following particulars of Mr. Vinod, prepare bank reconciliation statement as on March 31, 2017. 1.

However, businesses sometimes have overdrafts at the bank. Overdrafts are where the bank account becomes negative and the businesses in effect have borrowed from the bank. This is shown in the cash book as a credit balance. In the bank statement, where the balance is followed by Dr. (or sometimes OD) means that there is an overdraft and called debit balance as per passbook. An overdraft is treated as negative figure on a bank reconciliation statement. The following solved illustration will help you understand the preparation of bank reconciliation statement when there is an overdraft. Illustration 4 On March 31, 2017, Rakesh had on overdraft of ` 8,000 as shown by his cash book. Cheques amounting to ̀  2,000 had been paid in by him but were not collected by the bank.
