In nutshell, the various users have diverse financial information requirements from the business. For example we have classified the following into the category of internal and external users specifying their objectives and consequent information requirements.

Bank is equally concerned about the form in which the assets are held by the business. When more assets are held in cash or near cash form, the aspect is knnown as liquidity.

Identify the transactions, which that are recorded. 2. Record transactions in journal. Only those transactions are recorded which are measured in money terms. The system followed for recording is called double entry system whereby two aspects (debit and credit) of every transaction are recorded. Repeated transactions of same nature are recorded in subsidiary books, also called special journals. Instead of recording all transactions in journal, they are recorded in subsidiary books and the  journal proper. For example, the business would record all credit sales in sales book and all credit purchases in purchases book. The other examples of subsidiary books are return inwards book, return outwards book. An other important special book is cash book, in which all cash and bank transactions are recorded. The entries, which are not recorded in any of these books, are recorded in a residual journal called	journal	proper. 3. The entries appearing in the above books are posted in the respective accounts in the ledger. 4. The accounts are balanced and listed in a statement called trial balance. If the total amounts of debit and credit balances agree, accounts are taken as free from arithmetical errors. 5. The trial balance forms the basis for making the financial statements, i.e. trading and profit and loss account and balance sheet. 8.2 Distinction between Capital and Revenue A very important distinction in accounting is between capital and revenue items. The distinction has important implications for making of the trading and profit and loss account and balance sheet. The revenue items form part of  the trading and profit and loss account, the capital items help in the preparation of a balance sheet. 8.2.1 Expenditure Whenever payment and/or incurrence of an outlay are made for a purpose other than the settlement of an existing liability, it is called expenditure. The expenditures are incurred with a viewpoint they would give benefits to the business. The benefit of an expenditure may extend up to one accounting year or more than one year. If the benefit of expenditure extends up to one accounting period, it is termed as revenue	 expenditure. Normally, they are incurred for the day-to-day conduct of the business. An example can be payment of salaries, rent, etc. The salaries paid in the current period will not benefit the business in the next accounting period, as the workers have put in their efforts in the current accounting period. They will have to be paid the salaries in the next accounting period as well if they are made to work. If the benefit of expenditure extends more than one accounting period, it is termed 2024-25 Ch-8.indd   279 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM 280 Accountancy as capital expenditure. An example can be payment to acquire furniture for use in the business. Furniture acquired in the current accounting period will give benefits for many accounting periods to come. The usual examples of capital expenditure can be payment to acquire fixed assets and/or to make additions/ extensions in the fixed assets. Following points of distinction between capital expenditure and revenue expenditure are worth noting : (a) Capital expenditure increases earning capacity of business whereas revenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity. (b) Capital expenditure is incurred to acquire fixed assets for operation of business whereas revenue expenditure is incurred on day-to-day conduct of business. (c) Revenue exp enditure is generally recurring expenditure and capital expendi ture is non-recurring by nature. (d) Capital expenditure benefits more than one accounting year whereas revenue expenditure normally benefits one accounting year. (e) Capital expenditure (subject to depreciation) is re corded in balance sheet whereas revenue expenditure (subject to adjustment for outstanding and prepaid amount) is transferred to trading and profit and loss account. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to classify the expenditure into revenue or capital category. In normal usage, the advertising expenditure is termed as revenue expenditure. The heavy expenditure incurred on advertising is likely to benefit the business firm for more than one accounting period. Such revenue expenditures, which are likely to give benefit for more than one accounting period, are termed as deferred	revenue	expenditure. It must be understood that expenditure is a wider term and includes expenses. Expenditure is any outlay made/incurred by the business firm. The part of the expenditure, which is perceived to have been used or consumed in the current year, is termed as expense of the current year. Revenue expenditure is treated as an expense for the current year and is shown in trading and profit and loss account. For example, salary paid by the business firm is treated as an expense of the current year. Capital expenditures are charged to income statement and are spread over to more than one accounting period. Hence, furniture of ̀  50,000 if expected to be used for 5 years will be treated as expense @ ` 10,000 per year. The name given for the expense is depreciation. The treatment of deferred revenue expenditure is same as of capital expenditure. They are also written-off over their expected period of benefit. 2024-25 Ch-8.indd   280 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM Financial Statements - I 281 8.2.2 Receipts The similar treatment is given to the receipts of the business. If the receipts imply an obligation to return the money, these are capital receipts. The example can be an additional capital brought in by the owner or a loan taken from the bank. Both receipts are leading to obligations, the first to the owner (called equity) and the other to the outsiders (called liabilities). Another example on a capital receipt can be the sale of a fixed asset like old machinery or furniture. However, if a receipt does not incur an obligation to return the money or is not in the form of a sale of fixed asset, it is termed as revenue receipt. The examples of revenue receipts sales made by the firm and interest on investment received by the firm. 8.2.3 Importance of Distinction between Capital and Revenue As stated earlier, the distinction between capital and revenue items has important implications for the preparation of trading and profit and loss account and the balance sheet as all items of revenue value are to the shown in the trading and profit and loss account and the items of capital nature in the balance sheet. If any item is wrongly classified, i.e. if any item of revenue nature is treated as capital item or vice-versa, the ascertainment of profit or loss will be incorrect. For example, the revenues earned during an accounting period are ` 10,00,000 and the expenses shown are ` 8,00,000, the profit shall work out as ` 2,00,000. On scrutiny of the details, you find that a revenue item of ` 20,000 (an expenditure on repairs of machinery) has been treated as capital expenditure (added to the cost of machinery and debited to machinery account, not to repairs account), and hence, does not form part of the expenses for the period. It means the actual expenses for the period are ` 8,20,000 and not ` 8,00,000. So, the correct profit is ` 1,80,000, not ` 2,00,000. In other words, the profit has been over stated. Similarly, if any capital expenditure is wrongly shown as revenue expenditure (for example, purchase of furniture shown as purchases), it will result in under statement of profits, and also an under statement of assets. Thus, the financial statements will not reflect the true and fair view of the affairs of the business. Hence, it is necessary to identify the correct nature of each item and treat it accordingly in the book of accounts. It is also important from taxation point of view because capital profits are taxed differently from revenue profits. 8.3 Financial Statements It has been emphasised that various users have diverse informational requirements. Instead of generating particular information useful for specific users, the business prepares a set of financial statements, which in general satisfies the informational needs of the users. 2024-25 Ch-8.indd   281 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM 282 Accountancy The basic objectives of preparing financial statements are : (a) To present a true and fair view of the financial performance of the business; (b) To present a true and fair view of the financial position of the business; and For this purpose, the firm usually prepares the following financial statements: 1. Trading and Profit and Loss Account 2. Balance Sheet1 Trading and Profit and Loss account, also known as Income statement, shows the financial performance in the form of profit earned or loss sustained by the business. Balance Sheet shows financial position in the form of assets, liabilities and capital. These are prepared on the basis of trial balance and additional information, if any. Example	1 Observe the following trial balance of Ankit and signify correctly the various elements of accounts and you will notice that the debit balances represent either assets or expenses/ losses and the credit balance represent either equity/liabilities or revenue/gains. [This trial balance of Ankit will be used throughout the chapter to understand the process of preparation of financial statements] Trial Balance of Ankit as on March 31, 2017 Account Title L.F.

It is basically a summary of revenues and expenses of the business and calculates the net figure termed as profit or loss. Profit is revenue less expenses. If expenses are more than revenues, the figure is termed as loss. Trading and Profit and Loss account summarises the performance for an accounting period. It is achieved by transferring the balances of revenues and expenses to the trading and profit and loss account from the trial balance. Trading and Profit and Loss account is also an account with Debit and Credit sides. It can be observed that debit balances (representing expenses) and losses are transferred to the debit side of the Trading and a Profit and Loss account and credit balance (representing revenues/gains) are transfered to its credit side. 8.4.1 Relevant Items in Trading and Profit and Loss Account The different items appearing in the trading and profit and loss account are explained hereunder: Items	on	the	debit	side (i)	 Opening	stock	: It is the stock of goods in hand at the beginning of the accounting year. This is the stock of goods which has been carried 2024-25 Ch-8.indd   283 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM 284 Accountancy forward from the previous year and remains unchanged during the year and appears in the trial balance. In the trading account it appears on the debit side because it forms the part of cost of goods sold for the current accounting year. (ii) Purchases less returns : Goods, which have been bought for resale appears as purchases on the debit side of the trading account. They include both cash as well as credit purchases. Goods which are returned to suppliers are termed as purchases return. It is shown by way of deduction from purchases and the computed amount is known as Net purchases. (iii) Wages : Wages refer to renumeration paid to workers who are directly engaged in factory for loading, unloading and production of goods and are debited to trading account. (iv)	 Carriage	 inwards/Freight	 inwards:	These expenses are the items of transport expenses, which are incurred on bringing materials/goods purchased to the place of business. These items are paid in respect of purchases made during the year and are debited to the trading account. (v)	 Fuel/Water/Power/Gas	: These items are used in the production process and hence are part of expenses. (vi) Packaging	material	and	Packing	charges	: Cost of packaging material used in the product are direct expenses  as it refers to small containers which form part of goods sold. However, the packing refers to the big containers that are used for transporting the goods and is regarded as an indirect expense debited to profit and loss account. (vii) Salaries : These include salaries paid to the administration, godown and warehouse staff for the services rendered by them for running the business. If salaries are paid in kind by providing certain facilities (called perks) to the employees such as rent free accommodation, meals, uniform, medical facilities should also be regarded as salaries and  debited to the profit and loss account. (viii) Rent paid : These include office and godown rent, municipal rates and taxes, factory rent, rates and taxes. The amount of rent paid is shown on the debit side of the profit and loss account. (ix)	 Interest	paid	: Interest paid on loans, bank overdraft, renewal of bills of exchange, etc. is an expense and is debited to profit and loss account. (x)	 Commission	paid:	Commission paid or payable on business transactions undertaken through the agents is an item of expense and is debited to profit and loss account. 2024-25 Ch-8.indd   284 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM Financial Statements - I 285 (xi) Repairs : Repairs and small renewals/ replacements relating to plant and machinery, furniture, fixtures, fittings, etc. for keeping them in working condition are included under this head. Such expenditure is debited to profit and loss account. (xii) Miscellaneous expenses : Though expenses are classified and booked under different heads, but certain expenses being of small amount clubbed together and are called miscellaneous expenses.  In normal usage these expenses are called Sundry	expenses or Trade expenses. Items	on	the	credit	side (i)	 Sales	 less	 returns	 : Sales account in trial balance shows gross total sales(cash as well as credit) made during  the year. It is shown on the credit side of the trading account. Goods returned by customers are called return inwards and are shown as deduction from total sales and the computed amount is known as net sales. (ii) Other	incomes	: Besides salaries and other gains and incomes are also recorded in the profit and loss account. Examples of such incomes are rent received, dividend received, interest received, discount received, commission received, etc. 8.4.2 Closing Entries The preparation of trading and profit and loss account requires that the balances of accounts of all concerned items are transferred to it for its compilation. • Opening stock account, Purchases account, Wages account, Carriage inwards account and direct expenses account are closed by transferring to the debit side of the trading and profit and loss account.

However, this list is not exhaustive. In real sense, there can be many more of other items, which we will be dealing at the later stage and there you will notice how this format undergoes a change with respect to each one of them.

Trading account and Profit and Loss account. The trading account or the first part ascertains the gross	profit and profit and loss account or the second part ascertains net	profit. Trading Account The trading account ascertains the result from basic operational activities of the business. The basic operational activity involves the manufacturing, purchasing and selling of goods.  It is prepared to ascertain whether the selling 2024-25 Ch-8.indd   288 9/13/2022   2:49:09 PM Financial Statements - I 289 of goods and/or rendering of services to customers have proved profitable for the business or not. Purchases is one of the main constituents of expenses in business organisation. Besides purchases, the remaining expenses are divided into two categories, viz. direct expenses and indirect expenses. Direct expenses means all expenses directly connected with the manufacture, pur chase of goods and bringing them to the point of sale. Direct expenses include carriage inwards, freight inwards, wages, factory lighting, coal, water and feul, royalty on production, etc. In our example-1, besides purchases, four more items of expenses are listed. These are wages, salaries, rent of building and bad debts.  Out of these items, wages is treated as direct expense while the other three are treated as indirect expenses. Similarly, sales constitute the main item of revenue for the business. The excess of sales over purchases and direct expenses is called gross	profit.  If the amount of purchases including direct expenses is more than the sales revenue, the resultant figure is gross loss. The computation of gross profit can be shown in the form of equation as : Gross Profit = Sales – (Purchases + Direct Expenses) The gross profit or the gross loss is transferred to profit and loss account. The indirect expenses are transferred to the debit side of the second part, viz. profit and loss account. All revenue/gains other than sales are transferred to the credit side of the profit and loss account. If the total of the credit side of the profit and loss account is more than the total of the debit side, the difference is the net	profit for the period of which it is being prepared. On the other hand, if the total of the debit side is more than the total of the credit side, the difference is the net loss incurred by the business firm. In an equation form, it is shown as follows : Net Profit = Gross Profit + Other Incomes – Indirect Expenses Net profit or net loss so computed is transferred to the capital account in the balance sheet by way of the following entry : (i) For	transfer	of	net	profit Profit and Loss A/c Dr. To Capital A/c (ii) For transfer of net loss Capital A/c Dr. To Profit and Loss A/c We are now redrafting the trading and profit and loss account to show gross profit and net profit of Ankit for the year ended March 31, 2017.

Besides gross profit, business has earned an income of ` 5,000 as commission received and has spent ` 42,500 (` 25,000 + `13,000 + `4,500) on expenses/losses including salaries, rent and bad debts. Therefore, the net profit is calculated as ` 4,500.

In our example, notice that purchases amount to ` 75,000 and wages amounts to ` 8,000. Hence, the cost of goods sold will be computed using the following formula : Cost of Goods Sold = Purchases + Direct Expenses = `75,000 + ` 8,000 = ` 83,000 As there is no unsold stock, the presumption here is that all the goods purchased have been sold. But in practice, there is  some unsold goods at the end of the accounting period. In our example, let us assume that out of the goods purchased amounting to ̀  75,000 in the current year, Ankit is able to sell goods costing ̀  60,000 only. In such a situation, the business will have an unsold stock of goods costing ` 15,000 in hand, also called closing stock. The amount of cost of goods sold will be computed as per the following equation : Cost of Goods Sold = Purchases + Direct Expenses – Closing Stock = ` 75,000 + ` 8,000 – ` 15,000 As a result, the amount of gross profit will also change with the existence of closing stock in business from ` 42,000 (as computed in figure 8.4) to ` 57,000 (refer figure 8.5).
