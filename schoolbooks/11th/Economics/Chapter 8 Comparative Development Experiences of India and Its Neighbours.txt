UNIIT IIIVI DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCES OF INDIA: A COMPARISON WITH NEIGHBOURS 2024-25 In today’s globalised world, where geographical boundaries are slowly becoming meaningless, it is important for neighbouring countries in the developing world to understand the development strategies being pursued by their neighbours. This is more so because they share the relatively limited economic space in world markets. In this unit, we will compare India’s developmental experiences with two of its important and strategic neighbours — Pakistan and China. 2024-25 8 COMPARATIVE DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCES OF  INDIA AND ITS NEIGHBOURS After studying this chapter, the learners will • figure out comparative trends in various economic and human development indicators of India and its neighbours, China and Pakistan • assess the strategies that these countries have adopted to reach their present state of development. 134 INDIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 2024-25 Geography has made us neighbours.

China has the second largest GDP (PPP) of $22.5 trillion in the world, whereas, India’s GDP (PPP) is $9.03 trillion and Pakistan’s GDP is $ 0.94 trillion, roughly about 11 per cent of India’s GDP.

COMPARATIVE DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCES OF INDIA AND ITS NEIGHBOURS 139 2024-25 Pakistan have more (Not to scale) proportion of urban population than India. In China, due to topographic and climatic conditions, the area suitable for cultivation is relatively small — only about 10 per cent of its total land area. The total cultivable area in China accounts for 40 per cent of the cultivable area in India. Until the 1980s, more than 80 per cent of the people in China were dependent on farming as their sole source of livelihood.

Ø India, Pakistan and China have similar physical endowments but totally different political systems. Ø All the three countries follow the similar planned pattern of development. However, the structures established to implement developmental policies are quite different. Ø Till the early 1980s, the developmental indicators of all the three countries, such as growth rates and sectoral contribution towards national income, were similar. Ø Reforms were introduced in 1978 in China, in 1988 in Pakistan and in 1991 in India. Ø China introduced structural reforms on its own initiative while they were forced upon India and Pakistan by international agencies. Ø The impact of policy measures were different in these countries — for instance, one-child norm has arrested the population growth in China whereas in India and Pakistan, a major change is yet to take place. Ø Even after seventy years of planned development, majority of the workforce in all the countries depends on agriculture. The dependency is greater in India. Ø Though China has followed the classical development pattern of gradual shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then to services, India and Pakistan’s shift has been directly from agriculture to service sector. Ø China’s industrial sector has maintained a high growth rate while it is not so in both India and Pakistan. This led to rapid increase of the GDP per capita in China than in India and Pakistan. Ø China is ahead of India and Pakistan on many human development indicators. However these improvements were attributed not to the reform process but the strategies that China adopted in the pre-reform period. Ø While assessing the developmental indicators, one also has to consider the liberty indicators. COMPARATIVE DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCES OF INDIA AND ITS NEIGHBOURS 147 2024-25 EXERCISES 1.
