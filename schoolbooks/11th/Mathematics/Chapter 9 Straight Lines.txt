Chapter 9 STRAIGHT LINES vG eometry, as a logical system, is a means and even the most powerful means to make children feel the strength of the human spirit that is of their own spirit.  – H. FREUDENTHALv 9.1  Introduction We are familiar with two-dimensional coordinate geometry from earlier classes. Mainly, it is a combination of algebra and geometry. A systematic study of geometry by the use of algebra was first carried out by celebrated French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, in his book ‘La Géométry, published in 1637. This book introduced the notion of the equation of a curve and related analytical methods into the study of geometry. The resulting combination of analysis and geometry is referred now as analytical geometry. In the earlier classes, we initiated the study of coordinate geometry, where we   studied about René Descartes coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a  (1596 -1650) plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the basics of coordinate geometry. Let us have a brief recall of coordinate geometry done in earlier classes. To recapitulate, the location of the points (6, – 4) and (3, 0) in the XY-plane is shown in Fig 9.1. We may note that the point (6, – 4) is at 6 units distance from the y-axis measured along the positive x-axis and at 4 units distance from the x-axis measured along the negative y-axis. Similarly, the point (3, 0) is at 3 units distance from the y-axis measured along  the positive x-axis and has zero distance from the x-axis. We also studied there following important Fig 9.1 formulae: 2024-25 152 MATHEMATICS I. Distance between the points P (x y ) and Q (x , y ) is 1,  1 2 2 ( )2 2 PQ = x2 – x1 + ( y2 – y1 ) For example, distance between the points (6, – 4) and (3, 0) is ( )2 ( 2 3 − 6 + 0 + 4) = 9 + 16 = 5  units. II. The coordinates of a point dividing the line segment joining the points (x y ) 1,  1  m x2 + n x1 m y + n y 2   1 and (x , y ) internally, in the ratio m: n are , 2  . 2  m + n m + n  For example, the coordinates of the point which divides the line segment joining 1.( − 3) + 3.1 A  (1, –3) and B (–3, 9) internally, in the ratio 1: 3 are given by x = = 0 1+ 3 1.9 + 3.(–3) and y = = 0. 1 + 3 III.   In particular, if m = n, the coordinates of the mid-point of the line segment  1 + 2 y + y joining the points (x  x x , 1 2  y ) and (x , y ) are  . 1,  1 2 2  2 2  IV. Area of the triangle whose vertices are (x y ), (x , y ) and (x , y ) is 1,  1 2 2 3 3 1 x1( y − 2 y3) + x2( y − 3 y1) + x3( y − 1 y2) . 2 For example, the area of the triangle, whose vertices are (4, 4), (3, – 2) and (– 3, 16) is 1 − 54 4(−2 −16) + 3(16 − 4) + (−3)(4 + 2) = = 27. 2 2 Remark If the area of the triangle ABC is zero, then three points A, B and C lie on a line, i.e., they are collinear. In the this Chapter, we shall continue the study of coordinate geometry to study properties of the simplest geometric figure – straight line. Despite its simplicity, the line is a vital concept of geometry and enters into our daily experiences in numerous interesting and useful ways. Main focus is on representing the line algebraically, for which slope is most essential. 9.2  Slope of a Line A line in a coordinate plane forms two angles with the x-axis, which are supplementary. 2024-25 STRAIGHT LINES       153 The angle (say) θ made by the line l with positive direction of x-axis and measured anti clockwise is called the inclination of the line. Obviously 0° ≤ θ ≤ 180° (Fig 9.2). We observe that lines parallel to x-axis, or coinciding with x-axis, have inclination of 0°. The inclination of a vertical line (parallel to or coinciding with y-axis) is 90°. Definition 1 If θ is the inclination of a line l, then tan θ is called the slope or gradient of the line l. Fig 9.2 The slope of a line whose inclination is 90° is not defined. The slope of a line is denoted by m. Thus, m = tan θ, θ ≠ 90° It may be observed that the slope of x-axis is zero and slope of y-axis is not defined. 9.2.1 Slope of a line when coordinates of any two points on the line are given We know that a line is completely determined when we are given two points on it. Hence, we proceed to find the slope of a line in terms of the coordinates of two points on the line. Let P(x , y ) and Q(x , y ) be two 1 1 2 2 points on non-vertical line l whose inclination is θ. Obviously, x  ≠ x , otherwise the line 1 2 will become perpendicular to x-axis and its slope will not be defined. The inclination of the line l may be acute or obtuse. Let us take these two cases. Draw perpendicular QR to x-axis and PM perpendicular to RQ as shown in Figs. 9.3 (i) and (ii). Fig 9. 3 (i) Case 1 When angle  θ is acute: In Fig 9.3 (i), ∠MPQ =  θ. ... (1) Therefore, slope of line l = m = tan θ. MQ y − But in ∆MPQ, we have tanθ 2 y = = 1 . ... (2) MP x2 − x1 2024-25 154 MATHEMATICS From equations (1) and (2), we have y2 − y m= 1 . x2 − x1 Case II  When angle θ is obtuse: In Fig 9.3 (ii), we have ∠MPQ = 180° –  θ. Therefore,  θ = 180° – ∠MPQ. Now, slope of the line l Fig 9. 3 (ii) m = tan θ = tan ( 180° – ∠MPQ) = – tan  ∠MPQ MQ y − y y2 − y1 = − = − 2 1  = . MP x1 − x x2 − x 2 1 Consequently, we see that in both the cases the slope m of the line through the points y (x m= 2 − y1 , y ) and (x , y ) is given by  . 1 1 2 2 x2 − x1 9.2.2 Conditions for parallelism and perpendicularity of lines in terms of their slopes In a coordinate plane, suppose that non-vertical lines l and l  have slopes m 1 2 1 and m , respectively. Let their inclinations be α and 2 β, respectively. If the line l  is parallel to l (Fig 9.4), then their 1 2 inclinations are equal, i.e., α = β, and hence, tan α = tan β Therefore m  = m , i.e., their slopes are equal. 1 2 Conversely, if the slope of two lines l  and l 1 2 is same, i.e., m  = m . 1 2 Fig 9. 4 Then tan α = tan β. By the property of tangent function (between 0° and 180°), α = β. Therefore, the lines are parallel. 2024-25 STRAIGHT LINES       155 Hence, two non vertical lines l and l  are parallel if and only if their slopes 1 2 are equal. If the lines l  and l  are perpendicular (Fig 9.5), then β = α + 90°. 1 2 Therefore, tan β = tan (α + 90°) 1 = – cot α = − tanα 1 i.e., m  = − or m   m   = – 1 2 m 1 2 1 Conversely, if m   m   =  – 1, i.e., tan α tan β = – 1. 1 2 Then tan α = – cot β = tan (β + 90°) or tan (β – 90°) Fig 9. 5 Therefore, α  and β differ by 90°. Thus, lines l  and l  are perpendicular to each other. 1 2 Hence, two non-vertical lines are perpendicular to each other if and only if their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other, 1 i.e., m = −  or,  m  m  = – 1. 2 m 1 2 1 Let us consider the following example. Example 1 Find the slope of the lines: (a) Passing through the points (3, – 2) and (–1, 4), (b) Passing through the points (3, – 2) and (7, – 2), (c) Passing through the points (3, – 2) and (3, 4), (d) Making inclination of 60° with the positive direction of x-axis. Solution (a) The slope of the line through (3, – 2) and (– 1, 4) is 4 − (−2) 6 3 m = = = − −1− 3 −  . 4 2 (b) The slope of the line through the points (3, – 2) and (7, – 2) is –2 – (–2) 0 m = = = 0 . 7 – 3 4 (c) The slope of the line through the points (3, – 2) and (3, 4) is 2024-25 156 MATHEMATICS 4 – (–2) 6 m = = , which is not defined. 3 – 3 0 (d) Here inclination of the line α = 60°. Therefore, slope of the line is m = tan 60° = 3 . 9.2.3 Angle between two lines When we think about more than one line in a plane, then we find that these lines are either intersecting or parallel. Here we will discuss the angle between two lines in terms of their slopes. Let L  and L  be two non-vertical lines with slopes m  and m , respectively. If α 1 2 1 2  1 and α  are the inclinations of lines L  and L , respectively. Then 2 1 2 m1 = tanα1 and m = tanα 2 2 . We know that when two lines intersect each other, they make two pairs of vertically opposite angles such that sum of any two adjacent angles is 180°. Let θ and φ be the adjacent angles between the lines L  and L (Fig 9.6). Then 1 2 θ = α  – α  and α , α   ≠ 90°. 2 1 1 2 tanα − tanα m −m Therefore  tan θ = tan (α  – α ) = 2 1 = 2 1    (as 1 + m m ≠ 0) 2 1 1+ tanα1 tanα2 1+ m1m 1 2 2 and φ = 180° – θ so that m −m tan φ = tan (180° – θ ) = – tan θ = – 2 1 , as 1 + m m  ≠ 0 1+ m1m 1 2 2 Fig 9. 6 Now, there arise two cases: 2024-25 STRAIGHT LINES       157 m2 – m1 Case I  If is positive, then tan θ will be positive and tan φ will be negative, 1+ m1m2 which means θ will be acute and φ will be obtuse. m2 – m1 Case II  If is negative, then tan θ will be negative and tan φ will be positive, 1+ m1m2 which means that θ will be obtuse and φ will be acute. Thus, the acute angle (say θ) between lines L  and L  with slopes m  and m , 1 2 1 2 respectively, is given by m2 − m1 tan θ = , as 1+ m1m2 ≠ 0 . 1+ .. (1) m1m2 The obtuse angle (say φ) can be found by using φ =1800 – θ. π 1 Example 2  If the angle between two lines is and slope of one of the lines is , find 4 2 the slope of the other line. Solution We know that the acute angle θ between two lines with slopes m  and m 1 2 m2 − m1 is given by tan θ = + ... (1) 1 m1m2 1 π Let m = , m  = m and θ = . 1 2 2 4 Now, putting these values in (1), we get 1 1 m − m − π tan = 2 or  1 = 2 , 4 1 1 1+ m 1+ m 2 2 1 1 m − m − 2 = 1 or 2 = –1. which gives 1 1 1+ m 1+ m 2 2 2024-25 158 MATHEMATICS 1 Therefore m = 3 or m = − . 3 Hence, slope of the other line is 1 3 or − . Fig 9.7 explains the 3 reason of two answers. Fig 9.7 Example 3 Line through the points (–2, 6) and (4, 8) is perpendicular to the line through the points (8, 12) and (x, 24). Find the value of x.

If slope of the line is m, show that 1 1 k – y = m (h – x ). 1 1 9.3   Various Forms of the Equation of a Line We know that every line in a plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship between line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem: How can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that for a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line. Suppose P (x, y) is an arbitrary point in the XY-plane and L is the given line. For the equation of L, we wish to construct a statement or condition for the point P that is true, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic equation involving the variables x and y. Now, we will discuss the equation of a line under different conditions. 9.3.1 Horizontal and vertical lines If a horizontal line L is at a distance a from the xaxis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either a or – a [Fig 9.8 (a)]. Therefore, equation of the line L is either y =  a or y = – a. Choice of sign will depend upon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the y-axis. Similarly, the equation of a vertical line at a distance b from the y-axis is either x = b or x =  – b  [Fig 9.8(b)]. 2024-25 160 MATHEMATICS Fig  9.8 Example 4 Find the equations of the lines parallel to axes and passing through (– 2, 3). Solution Position of the lines is shown in the Fig 9.9. The y-coordinate of every point on the line parallel to x-axis is 3, therefore, equation of the line parallel tox-axis and passing through (– 2, 3) is y = 3. Similarly, equation of the line parallel  to y-axis and passing through (– 2, 3) is x = – 2. 9.3.2 Point-slope form  Suppose that Fig  9.9 P  (x , y ) is a fixed point on a non-vertical 0 0 0 line L, whose slope is m. Let P (x, y) be an arbitrary point on L (Fig 9.10). Then, by the definition, the slope of L is given by y − y m = 0 , i.e.,  y − y = m (x − x 0 0) x − x0 ...(1) Since the point P  (x , y ) along with 0 0 0 all points (x, y) on L satisfies (1) and no other point in the plane satisfies (1). Equation (1) is indeed the equation for the given line L. Fig 9.10 2024-25 STRAIGHT LINES       161 Thus, the point (x, y) lies on the line with slope m through the fixed point (x , y ), 0 0 if and only if, its coordinates satisfy the equation y – y  = m (x – x ) 0 0 Example 5 Find the equation of the line through (– 2, 3) with slope – 4. Solution Here m = – 4 and given point (x , y ) is (– 2, 3). 0 0 By slope-intercept form formula (1) above, equation of the given line is y – 3 = – 4 (x + 2) or 4x + y + 5 = 0, which is the required equation. 9.3.3 Two-point form Let the line L passes through two given points P  (x , y ) and P  (x , y ). 1 1 1 2 2 2 Let P (x, y) be a general point on L (Fig 9.11). The three points P , P and P are Fig 9.11 1 2 collinear, therefore, we have slope of P P = slope of P P 1 1 2 y − y1 y − 2 y1 y − 2 y1 i.e.,   = , or y − y = ( x − x ). x − 1 1 x1 x2 − x1 x2 − x1 Thus, equation of the line passing through the points (x , y ) and (x , y ) is given by 1 1 2 2 y − y 2 y y − = 1 (x − x 1 1) ... (2) x2 − x1 Example 6 Write the equation of the line through the points (1, –1) and (3, 5). Solution Here x  = 1, y  = – 1, x  = 3 and y  = 5. Using two-point form (2) above 1 1 2 2 for the equation of the line, we have ( ) 5 – (–1) y – –1 = (x – 1) 3 – 1 or                        –3x + y + 4 = 0, which is the required equation. 9.3.4 Slope-intercept form Sometimes a line is known to us with its slope and an intercept on one of the axes. We will now find equations of such lines. 2024-25 162 MATHEMATICS Case I Suppose a line L with slope m cuts the y-axis at a distance c from the origin (Fig 9.12). The distance c is called the yintercept of the line L. Obviously, coordinates of the point where the line meet the y-axis are (0, c). Thus, L has slope m and passes through a fixed point (0, c). Therefore, by point-slope form, the equation of L is Fig 9.12 y − c = m( x − 0 ) or y = mx + c Thus, the point (x, y) on the line with slope m and y-intercept c lies on the line if and only if y = mx +c ...(3) Note that the value of c will be positive or negative according as the intercept is made on the positive or negative side of the y-axis, respectively. Case II Suppose line L with slope m makes x-intercept d. Then equation of L is y = m(x – d) ... (4) Students may derive this equation themselves by the same method as in Case I. 1 Example 7 Write the equation of the lines for which tan θ = , where θ is the 2 3 inclination of the line and  (i) y-intercept is –   (ii) x-intercept is 4. 2 1 3 Solution (i) Here, slope of the line is m = tan θ  = and y - intercept c = – . 2 2 Therefore, by slope-intercept form (3) above, the equation of the line is 1 3 y = x − or 2 y − x + 3 = 0 , 2 2 which is the required equation. 1 (ii) Here, we have m = tan θ  = and d = 4. 2 Therefore, by slope-intercept form (4) above, the equation of the line is 1 y = (x − 4) or 2y − x + 4 = 0 , 2 which is the required equation. 2024-25 STRAIGHT LINES       163 9.3.5 Intercept - form Suppose a line L makes x-intercept a and y-intercept b on the axes. Obviously L meets x-axis at the point (a, 0) and y-axis at the point (0, b) (Fig .9.13). By two-point form of the equation of the line, we have b − 0 y − 0 = (x − a) or ay = −bx + ab , 0 − a x y i.e., + = 1. a b Thus, equation of the line making intercepts Fig 9.13 a and b on x-and y-axis, respectively, is x y + = 1 ... (5) a b Example 8 Find the equation of the line, which makes intercepts –3 and 2 on the x- and y-axes respectively. Solution Here a = –3 and b = 2. By intercept form (5) above, equation of the line is x y + =1 or 2x − 3y + 6 = 0 . −3 2 Any equation of the form Ax + By + C = 0, where A and B are not zero simultaneously is called general linear equation or general equation of a line.
