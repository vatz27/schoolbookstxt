Chapter 13 STATISTICS v“Statistics may be rightly called the science of averages and their estimates.” – A.L.BOWLEY & A.L. BODDINGTON v 13.1  Introduction We know that statistics deals with data collected for specific purposes. We can make decisions about the data by analysing and interpreting it. In earlier classes, we have studied methods of representing data graphically and in tabular form. This representation reveals certain salient features or characteristics of the data. We have also studied the methods of finding a representative value for the given data. This value is called the measure of central tendency. Recall mean (arithmetic mean), median and mode are three measures of central tendency. A measure of central tendency gives us a rough idea where data points are Karl Pearson (1857-1936) centred. But, in order to make better interpretation from the data, we should also have an idea how the data are scattered or how much they are bunched around a measure of central tendency. Consider now the runs scored by two batsmen in their last ten matches as follows: Batsman A : 30, 91,  0, 64, 42, 80, 30, 5, 117,  71 Batsman B : 53, 46, 48, 50, 53, 53, 58, 60, 57, 52 Clearly, the mean and median of the data are Batsman A Batsman B Mean 53 53 Median 53 53 Recall that, we calculate the mean of a data (denoted by x ) by dividing the sum of the observations by the number of observations, i.e., 2024-25 258 MATHEMATICS 1 n x = ∑ xi n i = 1 Also, the median is obtained by first arranging the data in ascending or descending order and applying the following rule. th  n +1 If the number of observations is odd, then the median is     observation.  2  th  n  If the number of observations is even, then median is  the mean of    and  2  th  n +   1  observations.  2  We find that the mean and median of the runs scored by both the batsmen A and B are same i.e., 53. Can we say that the performance of two players is same? Clearly No, because the variability in the scores of batsman A is from 0 (minimum) to 117 (maximum). Whereas, the range of the runs scored by batsman B is from 46 to 60. Let us now plot the above scores as dots on a number line. We find the following diagrams: For batsman A For batsman B Fig 13.1 Fig 13.2 We can see that the dots corresponding to batsman B are close to each other and are clustering around the measure of central tendency (mean and median), while those corresponding to batsman A are scattered or more spread out. Thus, the measures of central tendency are not sufficient to give complete information about a given data. Variability is another factor which is required to be studied under statistics. Like ‘measures of central tendency’ we want to have a single number to describe variability. This single number is called a ‘measure of dispersion’. In this Chapter, we shall learn some of the important measures of dispersion and their methods of calculation for ungrouped and grouped data. 2024-25 STATISTICS            259 13.2  Measures of Dispersion The dispersion or scatter in a data is measured on the basis of the observations and the types of the measure of central tendency, used there. There are following measures of dispersion: (i) Range, (ii) Quartile deviation, (iii) Mean deviation, (iv) Standard deviation. In this Chapter, we shall study all of these measures of dispersion except the quartile deviation. 13.3 Range Recall that, in the example of runs scored by two batsmen A and B, we had some idea of variability in the scores on the basis of minimum and maximum runs in each series. To obtain a single number for this, we find the difference of maximum and minimum values of each series. This difference is called the ‘Range’ of the data. In case of batsman A, Range = 117 – 0 = 117 and for batsman B, Range = 60 – 46 = 14. Clearly, Range of A > Range of B. Therefore, the scores are scattered or dispersed in case of A while for B these are close to each other. Thus, Range of a series = Maximum value – Minimum value. The range of data gives us a rough idea of variability or scatter but does not tell about the dispersion of the data from a measure of central tendency. For this purpose, we need some other measure of variability. Clearly, such measure must depend upon the difference (or deviation) of the values from the central tendency. The important measures of dispersion, which depend upon the deviations of the observations from a central tendency are mean deviation and standard deviation. Let us discuss them in detail. 13.4 Mean Deviation Recall that the deviation of an observation x from a fixed value ‘a’ is the difference x – a. In order to find the dispersion of values of x from a central value ‘a’ , we find the deviations about a. An absolute measure of dispersion is the mean of these deviations. To find the mean, we must obtain the sum of the deviations. But, we know that a measure of central tendency lies between the maximum and the minimum values of the set of observations. Therefore, some of the deviations will be negative and some positive. Thus, the sum of deviations may vanish. Moreover, the sum of the deviations from mean ( x ) is zero. Sum of deviations 0 Also Mean of deviations = = = 0 Number of observations n Thus, finding the mean of deviations about  mean is not of any use for us, as far as the measure of dispersion is concerned. 2024-25 260 MATHEMATICS Remember that, in finding a suitable measure of dispersion, we require the distance of each value from a central tendency or a fixed number ‘a’. Recall, that the absolute value of the difference of two numbers gives the distance between the numbers when represented on a number line. Thus, to find the measure of dispersion from a fixed number ‘a’ we may take the mean of the absolute values of the deviations from the central value. This mean is called the ‘mean deviation’. Thus mean deviation about a central value ‘a’  is the mean of the absolute values of the deviations of the observations from ‘a’. The mean deviation from ‘a’ is denoted as M.D. (a). Therefore, Sum of absolute values of deviations from 'a' M.D.(a) = . Number of observations Remark  Mean deviation may be obtained from any measure of central tendency. However, mean deviation from mean and median are commonly used in statistical studies. Let us now learn how to calculate mean deviation about mean and mean deviation about median for various types of data 13.4.1  Mean deviation for ungrouped data  Let  n observations be x , x , x , ...., x . 1 2 3 n The following steps are involved in the calculation of mean deviation about mean or median: Step 1 Calculate the measure of central tendency about which we are to find the mean deviation. Let it be ‘a’. Step 2  Find the deviation of each x from a, i.e., x – a, x – a, x – a,. . . , x – a i 1 2 3 n Step 3 Find the absolute values of the deviations, i.e., drop the minus sign (–), if it is there, i.e., x1 − a , x2 − a , x3 − a ,...., xn − a Step 4 Find the mean of the absolute values of the deviations. This mean is the mean deviation about a, i.e., n ∑ xi − a M.D.(a) = i=1 n 1 n Thus M.D. ( x ) = ∑ xi − x , where x = Mean n i=1 1 n and M.D. (M) = ∑ xi −M , where M = Median n i=1 2024-25 STATISTICS            261 ANote  In this Chapter,  we shall use the symbol M to denote median unless stated otherwise.Let us now illustrate the steps of the above method in following examples. Example 1 Find the mean deviation about the mean for the following data: 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 4, 8, 12 Solution We proceed step-wise and get the following: Step 1  Mean of the given data is 6 + 7 +10 +12 +13+ 4 + 8+12 72 x = = = 9 8 8 Step 2  The deviations of the respective observations from the mean x,  i.e., x – x are i 6 – 9, 7 – 9, 10 – 9, 12 – 9, 13 – 9, 4 – 9, 8 – 9, 12 – 9, or    –3, –2, 1, 3, 4, –5, –1, 3 Step 3 The absolute values of the deviations, i.e., xi − x  are 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3 Step 4 The required mean deviation about the mean is 8 ∑ xi − x M.D. ( ) i=1 x  = 8 3+ 2 +1+ 3+ 4 + 5+1+ 3 22 = = = 2.75 8 8 ANote   Instead of carrying out the steps every time, we can carry on calculation, step-wise without referring to steps. Example 2 Find the mean deviation about the mean for the following data : 12, 3, 18, 17, 4, 9, 17, 19, 20, 15, 8, 17, 2, 3, 16, 11, 3, 1, 0, 5 Solution We have to first find the mean ( x ) of the given data 1 20 x = ∑ 200 xi  =   =  10 20 i=1 20 2024-25 262 MATHEMATICS The respective absolute values of the deviations from mean, i.e., xi − x  are 2, 7, 8, 7, 6, 1, 7, 9, 10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7, 6, 1, 7, 9, 10, 5 20 Therefore ∑ xi − x = 124 i=1 124 and M.D. ( x ) = = 6.2 20 Example 3 Find the mean deviation about the median for the following data: 3, 9, 5, 3, 12, 10, 18, 4, 7, 19, 21. Solution  Here the number of observations is 11 which is odd. Arranging the data into ascending order, we have  3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 21 th 11 + 1  Now Median  =    or 6th observation = 9  2  The absolute values  of  the respective deviations from the median, i.e., xi − M  are 6, 6, 5, 4, 2, 0, 1, 3, 9, 10, 12 11 Therefore ∑ xi −M = 58 i=1 1 11 1 and M.D. (M) = ∑ xi −M = ×58 = 5.27 11 i=1 11 13.4.2  Mean deviation  for grouped data We know that data can be grouped into two ways : (a) Discrete frequency distribution, (b) Continuous frequency distribution. Let us discuss the method of finding mean deviation for both types of the data. (a)  Discrete frequency distribution  Let the given data consist of n distinct values x , x , ..., x  occurring with frequencies f , f , ..., f  respectively. This data can be 1 2 n 1 2 n represented in the tabular form as given below, and is called discrete frequency distribution: x : x   x x  ... x 1 2 3 n f : f   f f  ... f 1 2 3 n 2024-25 STATISTICS            263 (i)  Mean deviation about mean First of all we find the mean x of the given data by using the formula n ∑ xi fi i 1 1 n x = = = x n ∑ i fi N , ∑ f i=1 i i=1 n where ∑ xi fi  denotes the sum of the products of observations x with their respective i i=1 n frequencies f  and N=∑ f  is the sum of the frequencies. i i i=1 Then, we find the deviations of observations x from the mean x and take their i absolute values, i.e., xi − x for all i =1, 2,..., n. After this, find the mean of the absolute values of the deviations, which is the required mean deviation about the mean. Thus n ∑ fi xi − x 1 n M.D. (x ) = i=1 n   = ∑ f i xi − x N ∑ i=1 fi i=1 (ii) Mean deviation about median To find mean deviation about median, we find the median of the given discrete frequency distribution. For this the observations are arranged in ascending order. After this the cumulative frequencies are obtained. Then, we identify N the observation whose cumulative frequency is equal to or just greater than , where 2 N is the sum of frequencies. This value of the observation lies in the middle of the data, therefore, it is the required median. After finding median, we obtain the mean of the absolute values of the deviations from median.Thus, 1 n M.D.(M) = ∑ f x −M i i N i=1 Example 4 Find mean deviation about the mean for the following data : x 2 5 6 8 10 12 i f 2 8         10 7   8   5 i 2024-25 264 MATHEMATICS Solution Let us make a Table 13.1 of the given data and append other columns after calculations. Table 13.1 x f f x xi − x f x − x i i i i i i 2 2 4 5.5 11 5 8 40 2.5 20 6 10 60 1.5 15 8 7 56 0.5 3.5 10 8 80 2.5 20 12 5 60 4.5 22.5 40 300     92 6 6 6 N =∑ f i =40 ,   ∑ fi xi =300 ,   ∑ f i xi − x =92 i=1 i=1 i=1 1 6 1 Therefore x = ∑ fi xi = × 300 = 7.5 N i=1 40 1 6 1 and M. D. (x ) = ∑ fi xi − x = × 92 = 2.3 N i=1 40 Example 5 Find the mean deviation about the median for the following data: x 3 6 9 12 13 15 21 22 i f 3 4 5 2 4 5 4 3 i Solution The given observations are already in ascending order. Adding a row corresponding to cumulative frequencies to the given data, we get (Table 13.2). Table 13.2 x 3 6 9 12 13 15 21 22 i f 3 4 5 2 4 5 4 3 i c.f. 3 7 12 14 18 23 27 30 Now, N=30 which is even. 2024-25 STATISTICS            265 Median is the mean of the 15th and 16th observations. Both of these observations lie in the cumulative frequency 18, for which the corresponding observation is 13. th th 15 observation +16 observation 13+13 Therefore,  Median M = = =13 2 2 Now, absolute values of the deviations from median, i.e., xi − M  are shown in Table 13.3.

(M) = ∑ fi xi −M N i=1 1 = ×149  = 4.97. 30 (b) Continuous frequency distribution A continuous frequency distribution is a series in which the data are classified into different class-intervals without gaps alongwith their respective frequencies. For example, marks obtained by 100 students are presented in a continuous frequency distribution as follows : Marks obtained 0-10 10-20 20-30 30-40 40-50 50-60 Number of Students 12 18 27 20 17 6 (i) Mean deviation about mean While calculating the mean of a continuous frequency distribution, we had made the assumption that the frequency in each class is centred at its mid-point. Here also, we write the mid-point of each given class and proceed further as for a discrete frequency distribution to find the mean deviation. Let us take the following example. 2024-25 266 MATHEMATICS Example 6 Find the mean deviation about the mean for the following data. Marks obtained 10-20 20-30 30-40 40-50 50-60 60-70 70-80 Number of students 2 3 8 14 8 3 2 Solution We make the following Table 13.4 from the given data : Table 13.4 Marks Number of Mid-points f x xi − x  f xi − x i i i obtained students f x i i 10-20 2 15 30 30 60 20-30 3 25 75 20 60 30-40 8 35 280 10 80 40-50 14 45 630 0 0 50-60 8 55 440 10 80 60-70 3 65 195 20 60 70-80 2 75 150 30 60 40 1800 400 7 7 7 Here N = ∑ fi = 40,∑ fi xi =1800, ∑ fi xi − x = 400 i=1 i=1 i=1 1 7 1800 Therefore x = ∑ fi xi = = 45 N i=1 40 1 7 1 and M.D.(x ) = ∑ fi xi − x = ×400 =10 N i=1 40 Shortcut method for calculating mean deviation about mean We can avoid the tedious calculations of computing x by following step-deviation method. Recall that in this method, we take an assumed mean which is in the middle or just close to it in the data. Then deviations of the observations (or mid-points of classes) are taken from the 2024-25 STATISTICS            267 assumed mean. This is nothing but the shifting of origin from zero to the assumed mean on the number line, as shown in Fig 13.3 Fig 13.3 If there is a common factor of all the deviations, we divide them by this common factor to further simplify the deviations. These are known as step-deviations. The process of taking step-deviations is the change of scale on the number line as shown in Fig 13.4 Fig 13.4 The deviations and step-deviations reduce the size of the observations, so that the computations viz. multiplication,  etc., become simpler. Let, the new variable be denoted xi − a by d , wh re a’ s t e a i = e ‘ i h ssumed mean and h is the common factor. Then, the h mean  x by step-deviation method is given by n ∑  fi  d = + = i x a i 1 × h N Let us take the data of Example 6 and find the mean deviation by using stepdeviation method. 2024-25 268 MATHEMATICS Take the assumed mean a = 45 and h = 10, and form the following Table 13.5. Table 13.5 xi − 45 Marks Number of Mid-points di = f x id x i i − f x − x obtained students 10 i i f x i i 10-20 2 15 – 3 – 6 30 60 20-30 3 25 – 2 – 6 20 60 30-40 8 35 – 1 – 8 10 80 40-50 14 45 0 0 0 0 50-60 8 55 1 8 10 80 60-70 3 65 2 6 20 60 70-80 2 75 3 6 30 60 40 0 400 7 ∑  fi  di Therefore   x = a + i=1 ×h N 0 = 45 + ×10 = 45 40 1 7 400 and      M.D. (x ) = ∑ fi xi − x = = 10 N i=1 40 ANote   The step deviation method is applied to compute x . Rest of the procedure is same. (ii) Mean deviation about  median The process of finding the mean deviation about median for a continuous frequency distribution is similar as we did for mean deviation about the mean. The only difference lies in the replacement of the mean by median while taking deviations. Let us recall the process of finding  median for a continuous frequency distribution. The data is first arranged in ascending order. Then, the median of continuous frequency distribution is obtained by first identifying the class in which median lies (median class) and then applying the formula 2024-25 STATISTICS            269 N −C Median = l + 2 × h f where median class is the class interval whose cumulative frequency is just greater N than or equal to , N is the sum of frequencies, l, f, h and C  are, respectively the lower 2 limit , the frequency, the width of the median class and  C the cumulative frequency of the class just preceding the median class. After finding the median, the absolute values of the deviations of mid-point x  of each class from the median i.e., xi − M  are obtained. i 1 n Then M.D. (M) = ∑ fi xi − M N i=1 The process is illustrated in the following example: Example 7 Calculate the mean deviation about median for the following data : Class 0-10 10-20 20-30 30-40 40-50 50-60 Frequency 6 7 15 16 4 2 Solution Form the following Table 13.6 from the given data : Table 13.6 Class Frequency Cumulative Mid-points xi −Med. f xi −Med. i frequency f (c.f.) x i i 0-10 6 6 5 23 138 10-20 7 13 15 13 91 20-30 15 28 25 3 45 30-40 16 44 35 7 112 40-50 4 48 45 17 68 50-60 2 50 55 27 54 50 508 2024-25 270 MATHEMATICS th N The class interval containing or 25th item is 20-30. Therefore, 20–30 is the median 2 class. We know that N −C Median = l + 2 × h f Here l = 20, C = 13, f  = 15, h = 10 and N = 50 25 −13 Therefore, Median = 20 + ×10  = 20 + 8 = 28 15 Thus, Mean deviation about median is given by 1 6 1 M.D. (M) = ∑ fi xi −M  = × 508  = 10.16 N i=1 50 EXERCISE 13.1 Find the mean deviation about the mean for the  data in Exercises 1 and 2. 1. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17 2. 38, 70, 48, 40, 42, 55, 63, 46, 54, 44 Find the mean deviation about the median for the  data in Exercises 3 and 4. 3. 13, 17, 16, 14, 11, 13, 10, 16, 11, 18, 12, 17 4. 36, 72, 46, 42, 60, 45, 53, 46, 51, 49 Find the mean deviation about the mean  for the data in Exercises 5 and 6. 5. x 5 10 15 20 25 i f 7 4 6 3 5 i 6. x 10 30 50 70 90 i f 4 24 28 16 8 i Find the mean deviation about the  median  for the data in Exercises 7 and 8. 7. x 5 7 9 10 12 15 i f 8 6 2 2 2 6 i 8. x 15 21 27 30 35 i f 3 5 6 7 8 i 2024-25 STATISTICS            271 Find the mean deviation about the mean for the data in Exercises 9 and 10. 9.

Thus, the mean deviation about median calculated for such series can not be fully relied. The sum of the deviations from the mean (minus signs ignored) is more than the sum of the deviations from median. Therefore, the mean deviation about the mean is not very scientific.Thus, in many cases, mean deviation may give unsatisfactory results. Also mean deviation is calculated on the basis of absolute values of the deviations and therefore, cannot be subjected to further algebraic treatment. This implies that we must have some other measure of dispersion. Standard deviation is such a measure of dispersion. 13.5 Variance and Standard Deviation Recall that while calculating mean deviation about mean or median, the absolute values of the deviations were taken. The absolute values were taken to give meaning to the mean deviation, otherwise the deviations may cancel among themselves. Another way to overcome this difficulty which arose due to the signs of deviations, is to take squares of all the deviations. Obviously all these squares of deviations are 2024-25 272 MATHEMATICS non-negative. Let x , x , x , ..., x  be n observations and x  be their mean. Then 1 2 3 n n (x −x)2 + (x )2 2 −x + .......+ (x −x)2 =  (x −x)2 1 n i . i=1 If this sum is  zero, then each (xi − x) has to be zero. This implies that there is no dispersion at all as all observations are equal to the mean x . n If ∑ (xi − x)2 is small , this indicates that the observations x , x , x ,...,x  are 1 2 3 n i=1 close to the mean x and therefore, there is a lower degree of dispersion. On the contrary, if this sum is large, there is a higher degree of dispersion of the observations n from the mean x . Can we thus say that the sum ∑ (xi − x)2 is a reasonable indicator i=1 of the degree of dispersion or scatter? Let us take the set A of six observations 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55. The mean of the observations is x = 30. The sum of squares of deviations from x for this set is 6 ∑ (xi − x)2 = (5–30)2 + (15–30)2 + (25–30)2  + (35–30)2 + (45–30)2 +(55–30)2 i=1 = 625 + 225 + 25 + 25 + 225 + 625 = 1750 Let us now take another set B of 31 observations 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. The mean of these observations is y = 30 Note that both the sets A and B of observations have a mean of 30. Now, the sum of squares of  deviations of observations for set B from the mean y  is given by
