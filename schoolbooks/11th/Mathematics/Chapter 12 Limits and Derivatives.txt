Chapter 12 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES vWith the Calculus as a key, Mathematics can be successfully applied to the explanation of the course of Nature – WHITEHEAD v 12.1  Introduction This chapter is an introduction to Calculus. Calculus is that branch of mathematics which mainly deals with the study of change in the value of a function as the points in the domain change. First, we give an intuitive idea of derivative (without actually defining it). Then we give a naive definition of limit and study some algebra of limits. Then we come back to a definition of derivative and study some algebra of derivatives. We also obtain derivatives of certain standard functions. 12.2  Intuitive Idea of Derivatives Sir Issac Newton Physical experiments have confirmed that the body dropped (1642-1727) from a tall cliff covers a distance of 4.9t2 metres in t seconds, i.e., distance s in metres covered by the body as a function of time t in seconds is given by s = 4.9t2. The adjoining Table 13.1 gives the distance travelled in metres at various intervals of time in seconds of a body dropped from a tall cliff. The objective is to find the veloctiy of the body at time t = 2 seconds from this data. One way to approach this problem is to find the average velocity for various intervals of time ending at t = 2 seconds and hope that these throw some light on the velocity at t = 2 seconds. Average velocity between t = t  and t = t  equals distance travelled between 1 2 t = t  and t = t seconds divided by  (t  – t ). Hence the average velocity in the first 1 2  2 1 two seconds 2024-25 218 MATHEMATICS Table 12.1 Distance travelled between t2 = 2 and t1 = 0 = t s Time interval (t2 − t1) 0 0 (19.6− 0)m 1 4.9 = = 9.8m / s . (2 − 0) s 1.5 11.025 1.8 15.876 Similarly, the average velocity between t = 1 and t = 2 is 1.9 17.689 1.95 18.63225 (19.6 – 4.9)m 2 19.6 ( = 14.7 m/s 2 −1) s 2.05 20.59225 Likewise we compute the average velocitiy 2.1 21.609 between t = t  and t = 2 for various t . The following 2.2 23.716 1 1 Table 13.2 gives the average velocity (v), t = t 2.5 30.625 1 seconds and t = 2 seconds. 3 44.1 4 78.4 Table 12.2 t 0 1 1.5 1.8 1.9 1.95 1.99 1 v 9.8 14.7 17.15 18.62 19.11 19.355 19.551 From Table 12.2, we observe that the average velocity is gradually increasing. As we make the time intervals ending at t = 2 smaller, we see that we get a better idea of the velocity at t = 2. Hoping that nothing really dramatic happens between 1.99 seconds and 2 seconds, we conclude that the average velocity at t = 2 seconds is just above 19.551m/s. This conclusion is somewhat strengthened by the following set of computation. Compute the average velocities for various time intervals starting at t = 2 seconds. As before the average velocity v between t = 2 seconds and t = t  seconds is 2 Distance  travelled between 2 seconds and t2 seconds = t2 − 2 Distance  travelled in t seconds  Distance travelled in 2 seconds = 2 − t2 − 2 2024-25 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            219 Distance  travelled in t seconds −  19.6 = 2 t2 − 2 The following Table 12.3 gives the average velocity v in metres per second between t = 2 seconds and t  seconds. 2 Table 12.3 t 4 3 2.5 2.2 2.1 2.05 2.01 2 v 29.4 24.5 22.05 20.58 20.09 19.845 19.649 Here again we note that if we take smaller time intervals starting at t = 2, we get better idea of the velocity at t = 2. In the first set of computations, what we have done is to find average velocities in increasing time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens just before t = 2. In the second set of computations, we have found the average velocities decreasing in time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens just after t = 2. Purely on the physical grounds, both these sequences of average velocities must approach a common limit. We can safely conclude that the velocity of the body at t = 2 is between 19.551m/s and 19.649 m/s. Technically, we say that the instantaneous velocity at t = 2 is between 19.551 m/s and 19.649 m/s. As is well-known, velocity is the rate of change of displacement. Hence what we have accomplished is the following. From the given data of distance covered at various time instants we have estimated the rate of change of the distance at a given instant of time. We say that the derivative of the distance function s = 4.9t2 at t = 2 is between 19.551 and 19.649. An alternate way of viewing this limiting process is shown in Fig 12.1. This is a plot of distance s of the body from the top of the cliff versus the time t elapsed. In the limit as the sequence of time intervals h , h , ..., approaches 1 2 zero, the sequence of average velocities approaches the same limit as does the sequence of ratios Fig 12.1 2024-25 220 MATHEMATICS C1B1 C2B, 2 C , 3B3 , ... AC1 AC2 AC3 where C B  = s  – s  is the distance travelled by the body in the time interval h  = AC , 1 1 1 0 1 1 etc. From the Fig 12.1 it is safe to conclude that this latter sequence approaches the slope of the tangent to the curve at point A. In other words, the instantaneous velocity v(t) of a body at time t = 2 is equal to the slope of the tangent of the curve s = 4.9t2 at t = 2. 12.3 Limits The above discussion clearly points towards the fact that we need to understand limiting process in greater clarity. We study a few illustrative examples to gain some familiarity with the concept of limits. Consider the function f(x) = x2. Observe that as x takes values very close to 0, the value of f(x) also moves towards 0 (See Fig 2.10 Chapter 2). We say lim f (x) = 0 x→0 (to be read as limit of f (x) as x tends to zero equals zero).  The limit of f (x) as x tends to zero is to be thought of as the value f (x) should assume at x = 0. In general as x → a, f (x) → l, then l is called limit of the function f (x) which is symbolically written as lim f (x) = l . x→a Consider the following function g(x) = |x|, x ≠ 0. Observe that g(0) is not defined. Computing the value of g(x) for values of x very near to 0, we see that the value of g(x) moves towards 0. So, lim x→  g(x) = 0. This is intuitively 0 clear from the graph of y = |x| for x ≠ 0. (See Fig 2.13, Chapter 2). Consider the following function. 2 ( ) x − 4 h x = , x ≠ 2 . x − 2 Compute the value of h(x) for values  of x very near to 2 (but not at 2). Convince yourself that all these values are near to 4. This is somewhat strengthened by considering the graph of the function y = h(x) given here (Fig 12.2). Fig 12.2 2024-25 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            221 In all these illustrations the value which the function should assume at a given point x = a did not really depend on how is x tending to a. Note that there are essentially two ways x could approach a number a  either from left or from right, i.e., all the values of x near a could be less than a or could be greater than a. This naturally leads to two limits – the right hand limit and the left hand limit. Right hand limit of a function f(x) is that value of f(x) which is dictated by the values of f(x) when x tends to a from the right. Similarly, the left hand limit. To illustrate this, consider the function ( ) 1, x ≤ 0 f x =  2, x > 0 Graph of this function is shown in the Fig 12.3. It is clear that the value of f at 0 dictated by values of f(x) with x ≤ 0 equals 1, i.e., the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is lim f (x)=1 x→ . 0 Similarly, the value of f at 0 dictated by values of f (x) with x > 0 equals 2, i.e., the right hand limit of f (x) at 0 is lim f (x) = 2 . x→0+ Fig 12.3 In this case the right and left hand limits are different, and hence we say that the limit of f (x) as x tends to zero does not exist (even though the function is defined at 0). Summary We say lim x→ –  f(x) is the expected value of  f at x = a given the values of f near a x to the left of a. This value is called the left hand limit of f at a. We say lim f (x)  s t e e p c e  a u  f f → + i  h  x e t d v l e o   at x = a given the values of x a f near x to the right of a. This value is called the right hand limit of f(x) at a. If the right and left hand limits coincide, we call that common value as the limit of f(x) at x = a and denote it by lim x→  f(x). a Illustration 1 Consider the function f(x) = x + 10. We want to find the limit of this function at x = 5. Let us compute the value of the function f(x) for x very near to 5. Some   of the points near and to the left of 5 are 4.9, 4.95, 4.99, 4.995. . ., etc. Values of the function at these points are tabulated below. Similarly, the real number 5.001, 2024-25 222 MATHEMATICS 5.01, 5.1 are also points near and to the right of 5. Values of the function at these points are also given in the Table 12.4. Table 12.4 x 4.9 4.95 4.99 4.995 5.001 5.01 5.1 f(x) 14.9 14.95 14.99 14.995 15.001 15.01 15.1 From the Table 12.4, we deduce that value of f(x) at x = 5 should be greater than 14.995 and less than 15.001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between x = 4.995 and 5.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 5 as dictated by the numbers to the left of 5 is 15, i.e., lim f ( x) =15 . x→5– Similarly, when x approaches 5 from the right,  f(x) should be taking value 15, i.e., lim f (x) =15 . x→5+ Hence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are both equal to 15. Thus, lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) =15 x→5− . x→5+ x→5 This conclusion about the limit being equal to 15 is somewhat strengthened by seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.16, Chapter 2. In this figure, we note that as x approaches 5 from either right or left, the graph of the function f(x) = x +10 approaches the point (5, 15). We observe that the value of the function at x = 5 also happens to be equal to 15. Illustration 2 Consider the function f(x) = x3. Let us try to find the limit of this function at x = 1. Proceeding as in the previous case, we tabulate the value of f(x) at x near 1. This is given in the Table 12.5. Table 12.5 x 0.9 0.99 0.999 1.001 1.01 1.1 f(x) 0.729 0.970299 0.997002999 1.003003001 1.030301 1.331 From this table, we deduce that value of f(x) at x = 1 should be greater than 0.997002999 and less than 1.003003001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between 2024-25 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            223 x = 0.999 and 1.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 1 as dictated by the numbers to the left of 1 is 1, i.e., lim f (x) =1. x→1− Similarly, when x approaches 1 from the right, f(x) should be taking value 1, i.e., lim f (x) =1. x→1+ Hence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are both equal to 1. Thus, lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) =1 . x→1− x→1+ x→1 This conclusion about the limit being equal to 1 is somewhat strengthened by seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.11, Chapter 2. In this figure, we note that as x approaches 1 from either right or left, the graph of the function f(x) = x3 approaches the point (1, 1). We observe, again, that the value of the function at x = 1 also happens to be equal to 1. Illustration 3 Consider the function f(x) = 3x. Let us try to find the limit of this function at x = 2. The following Table 12.6 is now self-explanatory. Table 12.6 x 1.9 1.95 1.99 1.999 2.001 2.01 2.1 f(x) 5.7 5.85 5.97 5.997 6.003 6.03 6.3 As before we observe that as x  approaches 2 from either left or right, the value of f(x) seem to approach 6. We record this as lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) = 6 x→2− x→2+ x→2 Its graph shown in Fig 12.4 strengthens this fact. Here again we note that the value of the function at x = 2 coincides with the limit at x = 2. Illustration 4 Consider the constant function f(x) = 3. Let us try to find its limit at x = 2. This function being the constant function takes the same Fig 12.4 2024-25 224 MATHEMATICS value (3, in this case) everywhere, i.e., its value at points close to 2 is 3. Hence lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) = 3 x→2 x→2+ x→2 Graph of f(x) = 3 is anyway the line parallel to x-axis passing through (0, 3) and is shown in Fig 2.9, Chapter 2. From this also it is clear that the required limit is 3. In fact, it is easily observed that lim f (x) = 3  for any real number a. x→a Illustration 5 Consider the function f(x) = x2 + x. We want to find lim f (x) . We x→1 tabulate the values of f(x) near x = 1 in Table 12.7. Table 12.7 x 0.9 0.99 0.999 1.01 1.1 1.2 f(x) 1.71 1.9701 1.997001 2.0301 2.31 2.64 From this it is reasonable to deduce that lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) = 2 x→1− . x→1+ x→1 From the graph of f(x) = x2 + x shown in the Fig 12.5,  it is clear that as x approaches 1, the graph approaches (1, 2). Here, again we observe that the lim  f (x) = f (1) x→1 Now, convince yourself of the Fig 12.5 following three facts: lim x2 =1, lim x =1 and lim x +1= 2 x→1 x→1 x→1 x2 2 Then lim + lim x =1+1= 2 = lim x + x x→1 x→1 x→1  .

We are interested in lim sin x , π x→ 2 where the angle is measured in radians. π Here, we tabulate the (approximate) value of f(x) near (Table 12.8). From 2 this, we may deduce that lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) =1 π− π + π x→ x→ x→ . 2 2 2 Further, this is supported by the graph of f(x) = sin x which is given in the Fig 3.8 (Chapter 3). In this case too, we observe that lim  sin x = 1. π x→ 2 Table 12.8 π π π π x − 0.1 − 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.1 2 2 2 2 f(x) 0.9950 0.9999 0.9999 0.9950 Illustration 7 Consider the function f(x) = x + cos x. We want to find the lim f (x). x→0 Here we tabulate the (approximate) value of f(x) near 0 (Table 12.9).

We want to know lim 2 f (x). x x→0 Here, observe that the domain of the function is given to be all positive real numbers. Hence, when we tabulate the values of f(x), it does not make sense to talk of x approaching 0 from the left. Below we tabulate the values of the function for positive x close to 0 (in this table n denotes any positive integer). From the Table 12.10 given below, we see that as x tends to 0, f(x) becomes larger and larger. What we mean here is that the value of f(x) may be made larger than any given number. Table 12.10 x 1 0.1 0.01 10–n f(x) 1 100 10000 102n Mathematically, we say lim f (x) = +∞ x→0 We also remark that we will not come across such limits in this course. Illustration 9 We want to find lim f ( x) , where x→0 x − 2, x < 0 (  f x) =  0 , x = 0  x + 2, x > 0 As usual we make a table of x near 0 with f(x). Observe that for negative values of x we need to evaluate x – 2 and for positive values, we need to evaluate x + 2. Table 12.11 x – 0.1 – 0.01 – 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.1 f(x) – 2.1 – 2.01 – 2.001 2.001 2.01 2.1 From the first three entries of the Table 12.11, we deduce that the value of the function is decreasing to –2 and hence. lim f (x) = −2 x→0− 2024-25 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            227 From the last three entires of the table we deduce that the value of the function is increasing from 2 and hence lim f (x) = 2 x→0+ Since the left and right hand limits at 0 do not coincide, we say that the limit of the function at 0 does not exist. Graph of this function is given in the Fig12.6. Here, we remark that the value of the function at x = 0 is well defined and is, indeed, equal to 0, but the limit of the function at x = 0 is not even defined. Fig 12.6 Illustration 10 As a final illustration, we find lim f (x) , x→1 where 2 1 ( ) x + x ≠ f x =   0 x =1 Table 12.12 x 0.9 0.99 0.999 1.001 1.01 1.1 f(x) 2.9 2.99 2.999 3.001 3.01 3.1 As usual we tabulate the values of f(x) for x near 1. From the values of f(x) for x less than 1, it seems that the function should take value 3 at x = 1., i.e., lim f (x) = 3 . x→1− Similarly, the value of f(x) should be 3 as dictated by values of f(x) at x greater than 1. i.e. lim f (x) = 3 . x→1+ But then the left and right hand limits coincide and hence lim f (x) = lim f (x) = lim f (x) = 3 → − . x 1 x→1+ x→1 Graph of function given in Fig 12.7 strengthens our deduction about the limit. Here, we Fig 12.7 2024-25 228 MATHEMATICS note that  in general, at a given point the value of the function and its limit may be different (even when both are defined). 12.3.1  Algebra of limits In the above illustrations, we have observed that the limiting process respects addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as long as the limits and functions under consideration are well defined. This is not a coincidence. In fact, below we formalise these as a theorem without proof. Theorem 1 Let f  and g be two functions such that both lim  f (x) and  lim  g(x) exist. x→a x→a Then (i) Limit of sum of two functions is sum of the limits of the functions, i.e., lim [f(x) + g (x)] =  lim  f(x) +  lim  g(x). x→a x→a x→a (ii) Limit of difference of two functions is difference of the limits of the functions, i.e., lim [f(x) – g(x)] =  lim  f(x) –  lim  g(x). x→a x→a x→a (iii) Limit of product of two functions is product of the limits of the functions, i.e., lim  [f(x) . g(x)] =  lim  f(x).  lim  g(x). x→a x→a x→a (iv) Limit of quotient of two functions is quotient of the limits of the functions (whenever the denominator is non zero), i.e., f (x) lim f (x) lim = x→a x→a g (x) lim g (x) x→a ANote In particular as a special case of (iii), when g is the constant function such that  g(x) = λ , for some real number λ , we have lim (λ. f ) (x) = λ.lim f (x) . x→a x→a In the next two subsections, we illustrate how to exploit this theorem to evaluate limits of special types of functions. 12.3.2  Limits of polynomials and rational functions A function f is said to be a polynomial function of degree n f(x) = a  + a x + a x2 +. . . + a xn, where a s are real 0 1 2 n i numbers such that a  ≠ 0 for some natural number n. n We know that lim x = a.

Then g x lim g (x) g ( ) ( ) (a) lim f x = lim = x→a = x→a x→a h(x) lim h(x) h(a) x→a However, if h(a) = 0, there are two scenarios – (i) when g(a) ≠ 0 and (ii) when g(a) = 0. In the former case we say that the limit does not exist. In the latter case we can write g(x) = (x – a)k g (x), where k is the maximum of powers of (x – a) in g(x) 1 Similarly, h(x) = (x – a)l h  (x) as h (a) = 0. Now, if k > l, we have 1 k lim g (x) lim (x − a) g1 (x) lim f (x) = x→a = x→a x→a lim h(x) lim ( )l x − a h1 (x) x→a x→a 2024-25 230 MATHEMATICS ( − )(k−l ) lim x a g1 (x) 0.g1 (a x→a ) = = = 0 lim h1 (x) h1 (a) x→a If k < l, the limit is not defined.
