Chapter 8 SEQUENCES AND SERIES vNatural numbers are the product of human spirit. – DEDEKIND v 8.1 Introduction In mathematics, the word, “sequence” is used in much the same way as it is in ordinary English. When we say that a collection of objects is listed in a sequence, we usually  mean that the collection is ordered in such a way that it has an identified first member, second member, third member and so on. For example, population of human beings or bacteria at different times form a sequence. The amount of money deposited in a bank, over a number of years form a sequence. Depreciated values of certain commodity occur in a sequence. Sequences have important applications in several Fibonacci spheres of human activities. (1175-1250) Sequences, following specific patterns are called progressions. In previous class, we have studied about arithmetic progression (A.P). In this Chapter, besides discussing more about A.P.; arithmetic mean, geometric mean, relationship between A.M. and G.M., special series in forms of sum to n terms of consecutive natural numbers, sum to n terms of squares of natural numbers and sum to n terms of cubes of natural numbers will also be studied. 8.2  Sequences Let us consider the following examples: Assume that there is a generation gap of 30 years, we are asked to find the number of ancestors, i.e., parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc. that a person might have over 300 years. Here, the total number of generations 300 = =10 30 2024-25 136       MATHEMATICS The number of person’s ancestors for the first, second, third, …, tenth generations are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, …, 1024. These numbers form what we call a sequence. Consider the successive quotients that we obtain in the division of 10 by 3 at different steps of division. In this process we get 3,3.3,3.33,3.333, ... and so on. These quotients also form a sequence. The various numbers occurring in a sequence are called its terms. We denote the terms of a sequence by a , a , a , …, a , …, etc., the 1 2 3 n subscripts denote the position of the term. The nth term is the number at the nth position of the sequence and is denoted by a The nth term is also called the general term of the n. sequence. Thus, the terms of the sequence of person’s ancestors mentioned above are: a  = 2, a  = 4, a  = 8, …, a  = 1024. 1 2 3 10 Similarly, in the example of successive quotients a  = 3, a  = 3.3, a  = 3.33, …, a  = 3.33333, etc. 1 2 3 6 A sequence containing finite number of terms is called a finite sequence. For example, sequence of ancestors is a finite sequence since it contains 10 terms (a fixed number). A sequence is called infinite, if it is not a finite sequence. For example, the sequence of successive quotients mentioned above is an infinite sequence, infinite in the sense that it never ends. Often, it is possible to express the rule, which yields the various terms of a sequence in terms of algebraic formula. Consider for instance, the sequence of even natural numbers 2, 4, 6, … Here a  = 2 = 2 × 1 a  = 4 = 2 × 2 1 2 a  = 6 = 2 × 3 a  = 8 = 2 × 4 3 4 ....     ....    .... ....     ....    .... ....     ....    .... ....     ....    .... a  = 46 = 2 × 23, a  = 48 = 2 × 24, and so on. 23 24 In fact, we see that the nth term of this sequence can be written as a  =  2n, n where n is a natural number. Similarly, in the sequence of odd natural numbers 1,3,5, …, the nth term is given by the formula, a  = 2n – 1, where n is a natural number. n In some cases, an arrangement of numbers such as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,.. has no visible pattern, but the sequence is generated by the recurrence relation given by a  = a  = 1 1 2 a  = a  + a 3 1 2 a  = a  + a , n > 2 n n – 2 n – 1 This sequence is called Fibonacci sequence. 2024-25 SEQUENCES AND SERIES       137 In the sequence of primes 2,3,5,7,…, we find that there is no formula for the nth prime. Such sequence can only be described by verbal description. In every sequence, we should not expect that its terms will  necessarily be given by a specific formula. However, we expect a theoretical scheme or a rule for generating the terms a , a , a ,…,a ,… in succession. 1 2  3 n In view of the above, a sequence can be regarded as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers or some subset of it. Sometimes, we use the functional notation a(n) for an. 8.3  Series Let a , a , a ,…,a , be a given sequence. Then, the expression 1 2  3 n a  + a + a  +,…+ a + ... 1 2  3 n is called the series associated with the given sequence .The series is finite or infinite according as the given sequence is finite or infinite. Series are often represented in compact form, called sigma notation, using the Greek letter ∑ (sigma) as means of indicating the summation involved. Thus, the series a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an   is abbreviated n as ∑ak k = . 1 Remark When the series is used, it refers to the indicated sum not to the sum itself. For example, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 is a finite series with four terms. When we use the phrase “sum of a series,” we will mean the number that results from adding the terms, the sum of the series is 16. We now consider some examples. Example 1 Write the first three terms in each of the following sequences defined by the following: n − 3 (i) an = 2n + 5, (ii) an = . 4 Solution  (i) Here  an = 2n + 5 Substituting n = 1, 2, 3, we get a  = 2(1) + 5 = 7, a  = 9, a  = 11 1 2 3 Therefore, the required terms are 7, 9 and 11. n − 3 1− 3 1 1 (ii) Here an = . Thus, a1 = = − , a2 = − , a3 = 0 4 4 2 4 2024-25 138       MATHEMATICS Hence, the first three terms are 1 1 – , –  and 0. 2 4 Example 2 What is the 20th term of the sequence defined by an = (n – 1) (2 – n) (3 + n) ? Solution Putting n = 20 , we obtain a  = (20 – 1) (2 – 20) (3 + 20) 20 =  19 × (– 18) × (23) = – 7866. Example 3 Let the sequence an be defined as follows: a  = 1,  a  = a  + 2 for n ≥ 2. 1 n n – 1 Find first five terms and write corresponding series. Solution We have a  = 1, a  = a  + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3, a  = a  + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5, 1 2 1 3 2 a  = a  + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7, a  = a  + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9. 4 3 5 4 Hence, the first five terms of the sequence are 1,3,5,7 and 9. The corresponding series is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 +... EXERCISE 8.1 Write the first five terms of each of the sequences in Exercises 1 to 6 whose nth terms are: n 1.  a  = n (n + 2) 2. a = 3. a = 2n n n n +1 n 2n − 3 n2 + 5 4.  a  = 5.  a  = (–1)n–1 5n+1 6. a = n . n 6 n n 4 Find the indicated terms in each of the sequences in Exercises 7 to 10 whose nth terms are: n2 7.  a = 4n – 3; a , a 8. a = ;a n 7 n 17 24 n  2 n(n – 2) 9. a  = (–1)n – 1n3; a 10. an = ;a n 9 20 . n + 3 2024-25 SEQUENCES AND SERIES       139 Write the first five terms of each of the sequences in Exercises 11 to 13 and obtain the corresponding series: an−1 11. a  = 3, a  = 3a  + 2 for all n > 1 12. a  = – 1, a = , n ≥ 2 1 n n – 1 1 n n 13. a  = a  = 2, a  = a –1, n > 2 1 2 n n – 1 14.

Let us consider the following sequences: 1 –1 1 –1 (i) 2,4,8,16,..., (ii) , , ,  (iii) .01,.0001,.000001,... 9 27 81 243 ... In each of these sequences, how their terms progress? We note that each term, except the first progresses in a definite order. In (i), we have a = a , 2 = a3 a4 1 2 2, = 2, = 2  and so on. a1 a2 a3 1 a2  1 a3 1 a4 1 1 = = =   In (ii), we observe, a , , , =  and so on. 9 a1 3 a2 3 a3 3 Similarly, state how do the terms in (iii) progress? It is observed that in each case, every term except the first term bears a constant ratio to the term immediately preceding 1 it. In (i), this constant ratio is 2; in (ii), it is –  and in (iii), the constant ratio is 0.01. 3 Such sequences are called geometric sequence or geometric progression abbreviated as G.P. A sequence a , a , a , …, a , … is called geometric progression, if each term is 1 2 3 n a k + 1 non-zero and = r (constant), for k ≥ 1. a k By letting a  = a, we obtain a geometric progression, a, ar, ar2, ar3,…., where a 1 is called the first term and r is called the common ratio of the G.P. Common ratio in 1 geometric progression (i), (ii) and (iii) above are 2, –  and 0.01, respectively. 3 2024-25 140       MATHEMATICS As in case of arithmetic progression, the problem of finding the nth term or sum of n terms of a geometric progression containing a large number of  terms would be difficult without the use of the formulae which we shall develop in the next Section. We shall use the following notations with these formulae: a = the first term, r = the common ratio, l = the last term, n = the numbers of terms, S  = the sum of first n terms. n 8.4.1  General term of a G .P. Let us consider a G.P. with first non-zero term ‘a’ and common ratio ‘r’. Write a few terms of it. The second  term is obtained by multiplying a by r, thus a  = ar. Similarly, third term is obtained by multiplying a  by r. Thus, 2 2 a  = a r = ar2, and so on. 3 2 We write below these and few more terms. 1st term = a  = a = ar1–1, 2nd term = a  = ar = ar2–1, 3rd term = a  = ar2 = ar3–1 1 2 3 4th term = a  = ar3 = ar4–1, 5th term = a  = ar4 = ar5–1 4 5 Do you see a pattern? What will be 16th term? a = ar16–1 = ar15 16 Therefore, the pattern suggests that the nth term of a G.P. is given by a = arn–1. n S Thus, a, G.P. can be written as a, ar, ar2, ar3, … arn – 1; a, ar, ar2,...,arn – 1... ;according as G.P. is finite or infinite, respectively. The series a + ar + ar2 + ... + arn–1 or a + ar + ar2 + ... + arn–1 +...are called finite or infinite geometric series, respectively. 8.4.2.  Sum to n terms of a G .P. Let the first term of a G.P. be a and the common ratio be r. Let us denote by S  the sum to first n terms of G.P. Then n S  = a + ar + ar2 +...+ arn–1 ... (1) n Case 1 If    r = 1, we have  Sn = a + a + a + ... + a (n terms)  = na Case 2 If    r ≠ 1, multiplying (1) by r, we have rS  = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ... + arn ... (2) n Subtracting (2) from (1), we get (1 – r) S  = a – arn  = a(1 – rn) n n a( r −1) This gives or Sn = r −1 Example 4 Find the 10th and nth terms of the G.P. 5, 25,125,… . Solution Here a = 5 and r = 5. Thus, a  = 5(5)10–1 = 5(5)9 = 510 10 and a  = arn–1 = 5(5)n–1 = 5n . n 2024-25 SEQUENCES AND SERIES       141 Example 5 Which term of the G.P., 2,8,32, ... up to n terms is 131072? Solution Let 131072 be the nth term of the given G.P. Here a = 2 and r = 4. Therefore 131072 = a  = 2(4)n – 1 or 65536 = 4n – 1 n This gives 48 = 4n – 1. So that n – 1 = 8, i.e., n = 9. Hence, 131072 is the 9th term of  the G.P. Example 6 In a G.P., the 3rd term is 24 and the 6th term is 192.Find the 10th term. 2 Solution Here, a3 = ar = 24 ... (1) 5 and a6 = ar = 192 ... (2) Dividing (2) by (1), we get r = 2. Substituting r = 2 in  (1), we get a = 6. Hence a  = 6 (2)9 = 3072. 10 Example 7 Find the sum of first n terms and the sum of first 5 terms of the geometric 2 4 series 1+ + + ... 3 9 2 Solution   Here a = 1 and r = .

Solution Here a = 2, r = 2 and n = 10 a (rn −1) Using the sum formula S  = n r −1 We have S  = 2(210  – 1) = 2046 10 Hence, the number of ancestors preceding the person is 2046. 8.4.3  Geometric Mean (G .M.) The geometric mean of two positive numbers a and b is the number ab . Therefore, the geometric mean of 2 and 8 is 4. We observe that the three numbers 2,4,8 are consecutive terms of a G.P. This leads to a generalisation of the concept of geometric means of two numbers. Given any two positive numbers a and b, we can insert as many numbers as we like between them to make the resulting sequence in a G.P. Let G , G ,…, G  be  n numbers between positive numbers a and b such that 1 2 n a,G ,G ,G ,…,G ,b is a G.P.

Hence, we can insert 4, 16, 64 between 1 and 256 so that the resulting sequences are in G.P. 8.5  Relationship Between A.M. and G.M. Let  A and G be A.M. and G.M. of two given positive real numbers a and b, respectively. Then a + b A = and G = ab 2 Thus, we have a +b a A – G = − +b − 2 ab ab  = 2 2 ( )2 a − b = ≥ 0 ... (1) 2 From (1), we obtain the relationship  A ≥ G. Example 13 If A.M. and G.M. of two positive numbers a and b are 10 and 8, respectively, find the numbers. a +b Solution  Given that A.M.= =10 ... (1) 2 and G.M.= ab =8 ... (2) From (1) and (2), we get a + b = 20 ... (3) ab = 64 ... (4) Putting the value of a and b from (3), (4) in the identity (a – b)2 = (a + b)2 – 4ab, we get (a – b)2 = 400 – 256 = 144 or a – b = ± 12 ... (5) 2024-25 SEQUENCES AND SERIES       145 Solving (3) and (5), we obtain a = 4, b = 16 or a = 16, b = 4 Thus, the numbers a and b are 4, 16 or 16, 4 respectively. EXERCISE 8.2 5 5 5 1.

(1) But L.H.S. = (a2p2 – 2abp + b2) + (b2p2 – 2bcp + c2) + (c2p2 – 2cdp + d2), which gives (ap – b)2 + (bp – c)2 + (cp – d)2  ≥ 0          ... (2) Since the sum of squares of real numbers is non negative, therefore, from (1) and (2), we have, (ap  – b)2 + (bp  – c)2 + (cp  – d)2 = 0 or ap – b = 0, bp – c = 0, cp – d = 0 b c d This implies that  = = = p a b c Hence a, b, c and d are in G.P.
