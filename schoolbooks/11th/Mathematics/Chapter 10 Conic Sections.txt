176    MATHEMATICS Chapter 10 CONIC SECTIONS vLet the relation of knowledge to real life be very visible to your pupils and let them understand how by knowledge the world could be transformed. – BERTRAND RUSSELL v 10.1 Introduction In the preceding Chapter 10, we have studied various forms of the equations of a line. In this Chapter, we shall study about some other curves, viz., circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas. The names parabola and hyperbola are given by Apollonius. These curves are in fact, known as conic sections or more commonly conics because they can be obtained as intersections of a plane with a double napped right circular cone. These curves have a very wide range of applications in fields such as planetary motion, Apollonius design of telescopes and antennas, reflectors in flashlights (262 B.C. -190 B.C.) and automobile headlights, etc.  Now, in the subsequent sections we will see how the intersection of a plane with a double napped right circular cone results in different types of curves. 10.2 Sections of a Cone Let l be a fixed vertical line and m be another line intersecting it at a fixed point V and inclined to it at an angle α (Fig10.1). Suppose we rotate the line m around the line l in such a way that the angle α remains constant.  Then the surface generated is a double-napped right circular hollow cone herein after referred as Fig 10. 1 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       177 Fig 10. 2 Fig 10. 3 cone and extending indefinitely far in both directions (Fig10.2). The point V is called the vertex; the line l is the axis of the cone. The rotating line m is called a generator of the cone.  The vertex separates the cone into two parts called nappes. If we take the intersection of a plane with a cone, the section so obtained is called a conic section. Thus, conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a right circular cone by a plane. We obtain different kinds of conic sections depending on the position of the intersecting plane with respect to the cone and by the angle made by it with the vertical axis of the cone. Let β be the angle made by the intersecting plane with the vertical axis of the cone (Fig10.3). The intersection of the plane with the cone can take place either at the vertex of the cone or at any other part of the nappe either below or above the vertex. 10.2.1 Circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola When the plane cuts the nappe (other than the vertex) of the cone, we have the following situations: (a) When β = 90o,  the section is a circle (Fig10.4). (b) When α < β <  90o, the section is an ellipse (Fig10.5). (c) When β = α; the section is a parabola (Fig10.6). (In each of the above three situations, the plane cuts entirely across one nappe of the cone). (d) When 0 ≤ β < α; the plane cuts through both the nappes and the curves of intersection is a hyperbola (Fig10.7). 2024-25 178    MATHEMATICS Fig 10. 4 Fig 10. 5 Fig 10. 7 Fig 10. 6 10.2.2  Degenerated conic sections When the plane cuts at the vertex of the cone, we have  the following  different cases: (a) When α < β ≤ 90o, then the section is a point (Fig10.8). (b) When β = α, the plane contains a generator of the cone and the section is a straight line  (Fig10.9). It is the degenerated case of a parabola. (c) When 0 ≤ β < α, the section is a pair of intersecting straight lines (Fig10.10). It is the degenerated case of a hyperbola. 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       179 In the following sections, we shall obtain the equations of each of  these conic sections in standard form  by defining them based on geometric properties. Fig 10. 8 Fig 10. 9 Fig 10. 10 10.3 Circle Definition 1 A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point in the plane. The fixed point is called the centre of the circle and the distance from the centre to a point on the circle is called the radius of the circle (Fig 10.11). 2024-25 180    MATHEMATICS Fig 10. 11 Fig 10. 12 The equation of the circle is simplest if the centre of the circle is at the origin. However, we derive below the equation of the circle with a given centre and radius (Fig 10.12). Given C (h, k) be the centre and r the radius of circle. Let P(x, y) be any point on the circle (Fig10.12).  Then,  by the definition, | CP | = r . By the distance formula, we have (x – h)2 + (y – k)2 = r i.e. (x – h)2 + (y – k)2 = r2 This is the required equation of the circle with centre at (h,k) and radius r . Example 1  Find an equation of the circle with centre at (0,0) and radius r. Solution Here  h = k = 0. Therefore, the equation of the circle is x2 + y2 = r2. Example 2 Find the equation of the circle with centre (–3, 2) and radius 4. Solution Here h = –3, k = 2 and r = 4. Therefore, the equation of the required circle is (x + 3)2 + (y –2)2 = 16 Example 3 Find the centre and the radius of the circle x2 + y2 + 8x + 10y – 8 = 0 Solution  The given equation is (x2 + 8x)  + (y2 + 10y) = 8 Now, completing the squares within the parenthesis, we get (x2 + 8x + 16)  +  (y2 + 10y + 25)  = 8 + 16 + 25 i.e. (x + 4)2 + (y + 5)2 = 49 i.e. {x – (– 4)}2 + {y – (–5)}2 = 72 Therefore, the given circle has centre at (– 4, –5) and radius 7. 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       181 Example 4 Find the equation of the circle which passes through the points (2, – 2), and (3,4) and whose centre lies on the line x + y = 2. Solution Let the equation of the circle be (x – h)2 + (y – k)2 = r2. Since the circle passes through (2, – 2) and (3,4), we have (2 – h)2 + (–2 – k)2 = r2 ... (1) and (3 – h)2 + (4 – k)2 = r2 ... (2) Also since the centre lies on the line x + y = 2, we have h + k = 2 ... (3) Solving the equations (1), (2) and (3), we get h = 0.7,   k = 1.3  and r2 = 12.58 Hence, the equation of the required circle is (x – 0.7)2 + (y – 1.3)2 = 12.58.

The fixed line is called the directrix of the parabola and the fixed point F is called the focus (Fig 10.13). (‘Para’ means ‘for’ and ‘bola’ means ‘throwing’, i.e., the shape described when you throw a ball in the air). ANote   If the fixed point lies on the fixed line, then the set of points in the plane, which Fig 10. 13 are equidistant from the fixed point and the fixed line is the straight line through the fixed point and perpendicular to the fixed line.  We call this straight line as degenerate case of the parabola. A line through the focus  and perpendicular to the directrix  is called the axis of the parabola. The point of intersection of parabola with the axis is called the vertex of the parabola (Fig10.14). 10.4.1 Standard equations of parabola Fig 10.14 The equation of a parabola is simplest if the vertex is at the origin and the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis or y-axis. The four possible such orientations of parabola are shown below in  Fig10.15 (a) to (d). 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       183 Fig 10.15 (a) to (d) We will derive the equation for the parabola shown above in Fig 10.15 (a) with focus at (a, 0) a > 0; and directricx x = – a as below: Let F be the focus and l the directrix.  Let FM be perpendicular to the directrix and bisect FM at the point O.  Produce MO to X.  By the definition of  parabola, the mid-point O is on the parabola and is called the vertex of the parabola. Take O as origin, OX the x-axis and OY perpendicular to it as the y-axis.  Let the distance from the directrix to the focus be 2a. Then, the coordinates of the focus are (a, 0),  and the equation of the directrix is x + a = 0 as in Fig10.16. Let P(x, y) be any point on the parabola such that Fig 10.16 PF = PB, ... (1) where PB is perpendicular to l. The coordinates of B are (– a, y). By the distance formula, we have PF = 2 2 (x – a) + y  and PB = + 2 (x a) Since PF = PB, we have 2 2 2 (x – a) + y = (x + a) i.e. (x – a)2 + y2 = (x + a)2 or x2 – 2ax + a2 + y2 = x2 + 2ax + a2 or y2 = 4ax ( a > 0). 2024-25 184    MATHEMATICS Hence, any point on the parabola satisfies y2 = 4ax. ... (2) Conversely, let P(x, y) satisfy the equation (2) PF = 2 2 2 (x – a) + y = (x – a) + 4ax 2 = (x + a) = PB ... (3) and  so P(x,y) lies  on the parabola. Thus, from (2) and (3) we have  proved that the equation to the parabola with vertex at the origin, focus at (a,0) and directrix x = – a is y2 = 4ax. Discussion In equation (2), since a > 0, x  can assume any positive value or zero but no negative value and the curve extends indefinitely far into the first and the fourth quadrants. The axis of the parabola is the positive x-axis. Similarly, we can derive the equations of the parabolas in: Fig 11.15 (b) as y2 = – 4ax, Fig 11.15 (c) as x2 = 4ay, Fig 11.15 (d) as x2 = – 4ay, These four equations are known as standard equations of parabolas. ANote   The standard equations of  parabolas have focus on one of the coordinate axis; vertex at the origin and thereby the directrix is parallel to the other coordinate axis. However, the study of the equations of parabolas with focus at any point and any line as directrix is beyond the scope here. From the standard equations of the parabolas, Fig10.15, we have the following observations: 1. Parabola is symmetric with respect to the axis of the parabola.If the equation has a y2 term, then the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis and if the equation has an x2 term, then the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis. 2. When the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis the parabola opens to the (a) right if the coefficient of x is positive, (b) left if the coefficient of x  is negative. 3. When the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis the parabola opens (c) upwards if the coefficient of y is positive. (d) downwards if the coefficient of y is negative. 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       185 10.4.2 Latus rectum Definition 3 Latus rectum of a parabola is a line segment perpendicular to the axis of the parabola, through the focus and whose end points lie on the parabola (Fig10.17). To find the Length of the latus rectum of the parabola y2 = 4ax (Fig 10.18). By the definition of the parabola, AF = AC. But AC = FM = 2a Hence AF = 2a. And since the parabola is symmetric with respect to x-axis AF = FB and so AB = Length of the latus rectum = 4a. Fig 10.17 Fig 10.18 Example 5 Find the coordinates of the focus, axis, the equation of the directrix and latus rectum of the parabola y2 = 8x. Solution The given equation involves y2, so the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis. The coefficient of x is positive so the parabola opens to the right. Comparing with the given equation y2 = 4ax, we find that a = 2. Fig 10.19 Thus, the focus of the parabola is (2, 0) and the equation of the directrix of the parabola is x = – 2 (Fig 10.19). Length of the latus rectum is 4a = 4 × 2 = 8. 2024-25 186    MATHEMATICS Example 6 Find the equation of the parabola with focus (2,0) and directrix x = – 2. Solution Since the focus (2,0) lies on the  x-axis, the x-axis itself is the axis of the parabola. Hence the equation of the parabola is of the form either y2 = 4ax or  y2 = – 4ax. Since the directrix is x = – 2 and the focus is (2,0), the parabola is to be of the form y2 = 4ax with a = 2. Hence the required equation is y2 = 4(2)x = 8x Example 7 Find the equation of the parabola with vertex  at (0, 0) and focus at (0, 2). Solution Since the vertex is at (0,0) and the focus is at (0,2) which lies on y-axis, the y-axis is the axis of the parabola. Therefore, equation of the parabola is of the form x2 = 4ay. thus, we have x2 = 4(2)y, i.e., x2 = 8y. Example 8 Find the equation of the parabola which is symmetric about the y-axis, and passes through the point (2,–3). Solution Since the parabola is symmetric about y-axis and has its vertex at the origin, the equation is of the form x2 = 4ay or x2 = – 4ay, where the sign depends on whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. But the parabola passes through (2,–3) which lies in the fourth quadrant, it must open downwards. Thus  the  equation  is  of the form x2 = – 4ay. Since the parabola passes through ( 2,–3), we have 1 22   = – 4a (–3), i.e., a   = 3 Therefore, the equation of the parabola is  1 −  x2 = 4   y,  i.e.,  3x2 = – 4y.  3  EXERCISE 10.2 In each of the following Exercises 1 to 6, find the coordinates of the focus, axis of the parabola, the equation of the directrix and the length of the latus rectum. 1. y2 = 12x 2. x2 = 6y 3.    y2 = – 8x 4. x2 = – 16y 5. y2 = 10x 6.    x2 = – 9y In each of the Exercises 7 to 12, find the equation of the parabola that satisfies the given conditions: 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       187 7.

The two fixed points are called the foci (plural of ‘focus’) of the ellipse (Fig10.20). ANote  The constant which is the sum of the distances of a point on the ellipse from the two fixed points is always greater than the Fig 10.20 distance between the two fixed points. The mid point of the line segment joining the foci is called the centre of the ellipse.  The line segment through the foci of the ellipse is called the major axis and the line segment through the centre and perpendicular to the major axis is called the minor axis.  The end points of the major axis are called the vertices of the ellipse(Fig 10.21). Fig 10.21 Fig 10.22 We denote the length of the major axis by 2a, the length of the minor axis by 2b and the distance between the foci by 2c.  Thus, the length of the semi major axis is a and semi-minor axis is b (Fig10.22). 2024-25 188    MATHEMATICS 10.5.1 Relationship between semi-major axis, semi-minor axis and the distance of the focus from the centre of the ellipse (Fig 10.23). Take a point P at one end of the major axis. Sum of the distances of the point P to the foci is F P + F P = F O + OP + F P 1 2 1 2 (Since,  F P  = F O + OP) 1 1 = c + a + a – c = 2a Fig 10.23 Take a point Q at one end of the minor axis. Sum of the distances from the point Q  to the foci is F Q + F Q = 2 + 2 2 2 2 b c + b + c  =  2 1 + 2 2 b c Since both P and Q lies on the  ellipse. By the definition of ellipse, we have 2 2 2 b + c =  2a, i.e., a = 2 2 b + c or a 2 = b2 + c2 , i.e., c = 2 − 2 a b . 10.5.2 Eccentricity Definition 5 The eccentricity of an ellipse is the ratio of the distances from the centre of the ellipse to one of the foci and to one of the vertices of the ellipse (eccentricity is c denoted by e) i.e., e= . a Then since the focus is at a distance of c from the centre, in terms of the eccentricity the focus is at a distance of ae from the centre. 10.5.3 Standard equations of an ellipse The  equation of  an ellipse is simplest if the centre of the ellipse is at the origin and the foci are on the x-axis or y-axis.  The two such possible orientations are shown in Fig 10.24. We will derive the equation for the ellipse shown above in Fig 10.24 (a) with foci on the x-axis. 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       189 (a) Fig 10.24 Let F  and F  be the foci and O be the mid-point of the line segment F F . Let O 1 2 1 2 be the origin and the line from O through F  be the positive 2 x-axis and that through F as the negative x-axis. 1 Let, the line through O perpendicular to the x-axis be the y-axis. Let the coordinates of F be 1 (– c, 0) and F  be (c, 0) (Fig 10.25). 2 Let P(x, y) be any point on the ellipse such that the sum of the distances from P to the two foci  be 2a so given PF  + PF  = 2a.  ... (1) 1 2 Using the distance formula, we have x2 y2 (x + c)2 + y2 + (x − c)2 + y2   =  2a + =1 a2 b2 Fig 10.25 i.e., (x + c)2 + y2   =  2a – − 2 2 (x c) + y Squaring both sides, we get (x + c)2 + y2 = 4a2 – 4a 2 2 2 (x − 2 c) + y + (x −c) + y 2024-25 190    MATHEMATICS which on simplification gives c (x − c)2 + y2 = a − x a Squaring again and simplifying, we get x2 y2 + a2 a2 − c2  = 1 x2 y2 i.e., +  = 1 (Since c2 = a2 – b2) 2 2 a b Hence any point on the ellipse satisfies x2 y2 +   = 1. ... (2) 2 2 a b Conversely, let P (x, y) satisfy the equation (2) with 0 < c < a. Then  2 x  y2  = b2   1 − a2   Therefore, PF = (x )2 2 1 + c + y  a2 2 − 2 2 x  =    (x+ c) + b  2  a  2 2 2 2 2  a − x  =    (x + c) + (a −c ) 2   (since b2 = a2 – c2)  a  2  cx +  c =      a  = a + x  a  a c Similarly PF  a − x 2  = a c c Hence PF  + PF   =  a + x + a – x = 2a ... (3) 1 2 a a 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       191 2 2 x y So, any point that satisfies  + 2 2 = 1, satisfies the geometric condition and so a b P(x, y) lies on the ellipse. Hence from (2) and (3), we proved that the equation of an ellipse with centre of the origin and major axis along the x-axis is x2 y2 + 2 = 1. a b2 Discussion From the equation of the ellipse obtained above, it follows that for every point P (x, y) on the ellipse, we have x 2 y 2 = 1 −  ,  . .  x a 2   ≤ 1  i e ,  2 b 2  ≤  a2, so – a ≤  x ≤  a. Therefore, the ellipse lies between the lines x = – a and x = a and touches these lines. Similarly, the ellipse lies between the lines y = – b and y = b and touches these lines. 2 2 x y Similarly, we can derive the equation of the ellipse in Fig 10.24 (b) as + =1 2 2 . b a These two equations are known as standard equations of the ellipses. ANote  The standard equations of  ellipses have centre at the origin and the major and minor axis are coordinate axes. However, the study of the ellipses with centre at any other point, and any line through the centre as major and the minor axes passing through the centre and perpendicular to major axis are beyond the scope here. From the standard equations of the ellipses (Fig10.24), we have the following observations: 1. Ellipse is symmetric with respect to both the coordinate axes since if (x, y) is a point on the ellipse, then (– x, y), (x, –y) and (– x, –y) are also points on the ellipse. 2. The foci  always lie on the major axis.  The major axis can be determined by finding the intercepts on the axes of symmetry.  That is, major axis is along the x-axis if the coefficient of x2 has the larger denominator and it is along the y-axis if the coefficient of  y2 has the larger denominator. 2024-25 192    MATHEMATICS 10.5.4 Latus rectum Definition 6 Latus rectum of an ellipse is a line segment perpendicular to the major axis through any of the foci and whose end points lie on the ellipse (Fig 10.26). To find the length of the latus rectum 2 2 x y of the ellipse + =1 2 2 a b Let the length of AF  be l. 2 Fig  10. 26 Then the coordinates of A are (c, l ),i.e., (ae, l ) 2 2 x y Since A lies on the ellipse + =1 2 2 , we have a b 2 2 (ae) l + =1 2 2 a b ⇒ l2 = b2 (1 – e2) 2 2 2 2 2 c a – b b But e = = =1 – a2 a2 a2 4 b 2 b Therefore l2 = 2 , i.e., l = a a Since the ellipse is symmetric with respect to y-axis (of course, it is symmetric w.r.t. 2 2b both the coordinate axes), AF  = F B and so length of the latus rectum is . 2 2 a Example 9 Find the coordinates of the foci, the vertices, the length of major axis, the minor axis, the eccentricity and the latus rectum of the ellipse 2 2 x y + =1 25 9 2 2 x y Solution Since denominator of  is larger than the denominator of , the major 25 9 2024-25 CONIC SECTIONS       193 2 2 x y axis is along the x-axis. Comparing the given equation with  + =1 2 2 , we get a b a = 5 and b = 3. Also 2 2 c = a – b = 25 – 9 = 4 Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are (– 4,0) and (4,0), vertices are (– 5, 0) and (5, 0). Length of the major axis is 10 units length of the minor axis 2b is 6 units and the 4 2b2 18 eccentricity is  and latus rectum is =  . 5 a 5 Example 10 Find the coordinates of the foci, the vertices, the lengths of major and minor axes and the eccentricity of the ellipse  9x2 + 4y2 = 36. Solution The given equation of the ellipse can be written in standard form as 2 2 x y + =1 4 9 2 2 y x Since the denominator of  is larger than the denominator of , the major axis is 9 4 along the y-axis. Comparing the given equation with the standard equation 2 2 x y + =1 2 2 , we have b = 2 and a = 3. b a Also c = 2 2 a – b    =  9 – 4 = 5 c 5 and e = = a 3 Hence the foci are (0, 5 )  and (0, – 5 ), vertices are (0,3) and (0, –3), length of the major axis is 6 units, the length of the minor axis is 4 units and the eccentricity of the 5 ellipse is . 3 Example 11 Find the equation of the ellipse whose vertices are (± 13, 0) and foci are (± 5, 0). Solution Since the vertices are on x-axis, the equation will be of the form 2 2 x y + =1 2 2 , where a is the semi-major axis. a b 2024-25 194    MATHEMATICS Given that  a = 13, c = ± 5. Therefore, from the relation c2 = a2 – b2, we get 25 = 169 – b2 , i.e., b = 12 2 2 x y Hence the equation of the ellipse is + = 1 . 169 144 Example 12 Find the equation of the ellipse, whose length of the major axis is 20 and foci are (0, ± 5). Solution Since the foci are on y-axis, the major axis is along the y-axis.  So, equation x2 y2 of the ellipse is of the form  + =1 b2 a2 . Given that 20 a = semi-major axis = =10 2 and the relation c2 =  a2 – b2 gives 52 = 102 – b2  i.e., b2 = 75 Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is 2 2 x y + = 1 75 100 Example 13 Find the equation of the ellipse, with major axis along the x-axis and passing through the points (4, 3) and (– 1,4). x 2 y 2
