100       MATHEMATICS Chapter 6 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS vEvery body of discovery is mathematical in form because there is no other guidance we can have – DARWINv 6.1  Introduction Suppose you have a suitcase with a number lock. The number lock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9. The lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a particular sequence with no repetition. Some how, you have forgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only the first digit which is 7. In order to open  the lock, how many sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To answer this question, you may, immediately, start listing all possible arrangements of  9 remaining digits taken 3 at a time. But, this method will be tedious, because the number Jacob Bernoulli of possible sequences may be large. Here, in this Chapter, (1654-1705) we shall learn some basic counting techniques which will enable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact, these techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging and selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a principle which is most fundamental to the learning of these techniques. 6.2  Fundamental Principle of Counting Let us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many different pairs of a pant and a shirt, can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which a pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly, a shirt can be chosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore, there are 3 × 2 = 6 pairs of a pant and a shirt. 2024-25 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       101 Let us name the three pants as P , P , P   and the two shirts as S , S . Then, 1 2 3 1 2 these six possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.1. Let us consider another problem of the same type. Sabnam has 2 school bags, 3 tiffin boxes and 2 water bottles. In how many ways can she carry these items (choosing one each). A school  bag can be chosen in 2 different ways. After a school bag is chosen, a tiffin box can be chosen in 3 different ways. Hence, there are 2 × 3 = 6 pairs of school bag and a tiffin box. For each of these pairs a water bottle can be chosen in 2 different ways. Fig 6.1 Hence, there are 6 × 2 = 12 different ways in which, Sabnam can carry these items to school. If we name the 2 school bags as B , B , the three tiffin boxes as T , T , T  and 1 2 1 2 3 the two water bottles as W , W , these possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.2. 1 2 Fig 6.2 2024-25 102       MATHEMATICS In fact, the problems of the above types are solved by applying the following principle known as the fundamental principle of counting, or, simply, the multiplication principle, which states that “If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can occur in n different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events in the given order is m×n.” The above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events. For example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows: ‘If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can occur in n different ways, following which a third event can occur in p different ways, then the total number of occurrence to ‘the events in the given order is m × n × p.” In the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt was the number of different ways of the occurence of the following events in succession: (i) the event of choosing a pant (ii) the event of choosing a shirt. In the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different ways of the occurence of the following events in succession: (i) the event of choosing a school bag (ii) the event of choosing a tiffin box (iii) the event of choosing a water bottle. Here, in both the cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible orders. But, we have to choose any one of the possible orders and count the number of different ways of the occurence of the events in this chosen order. Example 1 Find the number of 4 letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word ROSE, where the repetition of the letters is not allowed. Solution There are as many words as there are ways of filling in 4 vacant places by the 4 letters, keeping in mind that the repetition is not allowed. The first place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 letters R,O,S,E. Following which, the second place can be filled in by anyone of the remaining 3 letters in 3 different ways, following which the third place can be filled in 2 different ways; following which, the fourth place can be filled in 1 way. Thus, the number of ways in which the 4 places can be filled, by the multiplication principle, is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Hence, the required number of words is 24. 2024-25 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       103 ANote   If the repetition of the letters was allowed, how many words can be formed? One can easily understand that each of the 4 vacant places can be filled in succession in 4 different ways. Hence, the required number of words = 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256. Example 2 Given 4 flags of different colours, how many different signals can be generated, if a signal requires the use of 2 flags one below the other? Solution There will be as many signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places in succession by the 4 flags of different colours. The upper vacant place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 flags; following which, the lower vacant place can be filled in 3 different ways by anyone of the remaining 3 different flags. Hence, by the multiplication principle, the required number of signals = 4 × 3 = 12. Example 3 How many 2 digit even numbers can be formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 if the digits can be repeated? Solution There will be as many ways as there are ways of filling 2 vacant places in succession by the five given digits. Here, in this case, we start filling in unit’s place, because the options for this place are 2 and 4 only and this can be done in 2 ways; following which the ten’s place can be filled by any of the 5 digits in 5 different ways as the digits can be repeated. Therefore, by the multiplication principle, the required number of two digits even numbers is 2 × 5, i.e., 10. Example 4 Find the number of different signals that can be generated by arranging at least 2 flags in order (one below the other) on a vertical staff, if five different flags are available. Solution A signal can consist of either 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags or 5 flags. Now, let us count the possible number of signals consisting of 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags and 5 flags separately and then add the respective numbers. There will be as many 2 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places in succession by the 5 flags available. By Multiplication rule, the number of ways is 5 × 4 = 20. Similarly, there will be as many 3 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 3 vacant places  in succession by the 5 flags. 2024-25 104       MATHEMATICS The number of ways is 5 × 4 × 3 = 60. Continuing the same way, we find that The number of 4 flag signals = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 = 120 and the number of 5 flag signals = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 Therefore, the required no of signals = 20 + 60 + 120 + 120 = 320. EXERCISE 6.1 1. How many 3-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 assuming that (i) repetition of the digits is allowed? (ii) repetition of the digits is not allowed? 2. How many 3-digit even numbers can be formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 if the digits can be repeated? 3. How many 4-letter code can be formed using the first 10 letters of the English alphabet, if no letter can be repeated? 4. How many 5-digit telephone numbers can be constructed using the digits 0  to 9 if each number starts with 67 and no digit appears more than once? 5. A coin is tossed 3 times and the outcomes are recorded. How many possible outcomes are there? 6. Given 5 flags of different colours, how many different signals can be generated if each signal requires the use of 2 flags, one below the other? 6.3 Permutations In Example 1 of  the previous Section, we are actually counting the different possible arrangements of the letters such as ROSE, REOS, ..., etc. Here, in this list, each arrangement is different from other. In other words, the order of writing the letters is important. Each arrangement is called a permutation of 4 different letters taken all at a time. Now, if we have to determine the number of 3-letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word NUMBER, where the repetition of the letters is not allowed, we need to count the arrangements NUM, NMU, MUN, NUB, ..., etc. Here, we are counting the permutations of 6 different letters taken 3 at a time. The required number of words = 6 × 5 × 4 = 120 (by using multiplication principle). If the repetition of the letters was allowed, the required number of words would be 6 × 6 × 6 = 216. 2024-25 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       105 Definition 1 A permutation is an arrangement in a definite order of a number of objects taken some or all at a time. In the following sub-section, we shall obtain the formula needed to answer these questions immediately. 6.3.1  Permutations when all the objects are distinct Theorem 1  The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time, where 0 < r ≤ n  and the objects do not repeat  is n ( n – 1) ( n – 2). . .( n – r + 1), which is denoted by nP . r Proof There will be as many permutations as there are ways of filling in r vacant places      . . .   by ← r vacant places → the n objects. The first place can be filled in n ways; following which, the second place can be filled in (n – 1) ways, following which the third place can be filled in (n – 2) ways,..., the rth place can be filled in (n – (r – 1)) ways. Therefore, the number of ways of filling in r vacant places in succession is n(n – 1) (n – 2) . . .   (n – (r – 1)) or n ( n – 1) (n – 2) ... (n – r + 1) This expression for nP  is cumbersome and we need a notation which will help to r reduce the size of this expression. The symbol n! (read as factorial n or n factorial ) comes to our rescue. In the following text we will learn what actually n! means. 6.3.2  Factorial notation  The notation n! represents the product of first n natural numbers, i.e., the product 1 × 2 × 3 × . . . × (n – 1) × n is denoted as n!. We read this symbol as ‘n factorial’. Thus, 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 . . .  × (n – 1) × n = n ! 1 = 1 ! 1 × 2 = 2 ! 1× 2 × 3 = 3 ! 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 4 ! and so on. We define 0 ! = 1 We can write   5 ! = 5 × 4 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1! Clearly, for a natural number n n ! = n (n  –  1) ! = n (n  –  1) (n  –  2) ! [provided (n ≥ 2)] = n (n  –  1) (n  –  2)  (n  –  3) ! [provided (n ≥ 3)] and so on. 2024-25 106       MATHEMATICS Example 5 Evaluate (i) 5 ! (ii) 7 ! (iii) 7 ! – 5! Solution (i) 5 ! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120 (ii) 7 ! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 ×7 = 5040 and (iii) 7 !  –  5! = 5040  –  120 = 4920. 7! 12! Example 6 Compute (i) (ii) 5! (10!) (2!) 7! 7× 6×5! Solution (i) We have  =  = 7 × 6 = 42 5! 5! 12! 12×11× (10!) and (ii)   =  = 6 × 11 = 66. (10!) (2!) (10!)× (2) n! Example 7 Evaluate r!(n − r )! , when n = 5, r = 2. 5! Solution We have to evaluate  2!(5 − 2)!  (since n = 5, r = 2) 5! 5! We have = 5 × 4 = 10 2 !(5 − 2)! = . 2!× 3! 2 1 1 x Example 8 If + = , find x. 8! 9! 10! 1 1 x Solution We have + = 8! 9×8! 10×9×8! 1 x 10 x Therefore 1+ =  or = 9 10×9 9 10×9 So x = 100.

Evaluate (n − r )! , when (i) n = 6, r = 2 (ii) n = 9, r = 5. 6.3.3  Derivation of the formula for nP r n n! Pr = ( ) , 0 ≤ r ≤ n n − r ! Let us now go back to the stage where we had determined the following formula: nP  = n (n – 1) (n – 2) . . .  (n – r + 1) r Multiplying numerator and denomirator by (n – r) (n – r – 1) . . . 3 × 2 × 1, we get n n(n −1) (n − 2) ...(n − r +1)(n − r )(n − r −1) ...3× 2×1 = n! Pr ( − )( −  = r − n r n 1) ...3× 2×1 ( , n − r )! n n! Thus Pr = (n − r )! , where 0 < r ≤ n This is a much more convenient expression for nP  than the previous one. r n n! In particular, when r = n, Pn = = n! 0! Counting permutations is merely counting the number of ways in which some or all objects at a time are rearranged. Arranging no object at all is the same as leaving behind all the objects and we know that there is only one way of doing so. Thus, we can have n! n! n P  = 1 = = ... (1) 0 n! (n − 0)! Therefore, the formula (1) is applicable for r = 0 also. n n! Thus Pr = , 0 ≤ r ≤ n (n − r )! . 2024-25 108       MATHEMATICS Theorem 2  The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time, where repetition is allowed, is nr. Proof is very similar to that of Theorem 1 and is left for the reader to arrive at. Here, we are solving some of the problems of the pervious Section using the formula for nP  to illustrate its usefulness. r In Example 1, the required number of words = 4P  = 4! = 24. Here repetition is 4 not allowed.  If repetition is allowed, the required number of words would be 44 = 256. The number of 3-letter words which can be formed by the letters of the word 6 6! NUMBER = P3 =  = 4 × 5 × 6 = 120. Here, in this case also, the repetition is not 3! allowed. If  the repetition is allowed,the required number of words would be 63 = 216. The number of ways in which a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman can be chosen from amongst a group of 12 persons assuming that one person can not hold more than 12 12! one position, clearly  P2 = = 11×12  = 132. 10! 6.3.4   Permutations when all the objects are not distinct objects  Suppose we have to find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word ROOT. In this case, the letters of the word are not all different. There are 2 Os, which are of the same kind. Let us treat, temporarily, the 2 Os as different, say, O  and O . The number of 1 2 permutations of 4-different letters, in this case, taken all at a time is 4!. Consider one of these permutations say, RO O T. Corresponding to this 1 2 permutation,we have 2 ! permutations RO O T and RO O T which will be exactly the 1 2 2 1 same permutation if O  and O  are not treated as different, i.e., if O  and O  are the 1 2 1 2 same O at both places. 4! Therefore, the required number of permutations = = 3× 4 = 12 . 2! Permutations when O , O  are       Permutations when O , O  are 1 2 1 2 different. the same O.

In this case there are 9 letters, in which I appears 2 times and T appears 3 times. Temporarily, let us treat these letters different and name them as I , I , T ,  T , T . 1 2 1 2 3 The number of permutations of 9 different letters, in this case, taken all at a time is 9 !. Consider one such permutation, say, I  NT  SI  T  U E T .  Here if I , I  are not same 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 2024-25 110       MATHEMATICS and T , T , T  are not same, then I , I  can be arranged in 2! ways and T , T , T  can 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 be arranged in 3! ways. Therefore, 2! × 3! permutations will be just the same permutation corresponding to this chosen permutation I NT SI T UET . Hence, total number of 1 1 2 2 3 9! different permutations will be 2! 3! We can state (without proof) the following theorems: Theorem 3 The number of permutations of n objects, where p objects are of the n! same kind and rest are all different = . p! In fact, we have a more general theorem. Theorem 4 The number of permutations of n objects, where p  objects are of one 1 kind, p  are of second kind, ..., p  are of kth kind and the rest, if any, are of different 2 k n! kind is . p1! p2! ... pk! Example 9 Find the number of permutations of the letters of the word ALLAHABAD. Solution Here, there are 9 objects (letters) of which there are 4A’s, 2 L’s and rest are all different. 9! 5× 6×7 ×8×9 Therefore, the required number of arrangements = =  = 7560 4!2! 2 Example 10 How many 4-digit numbers can be formed by using the digits 1 to 9 if repetition of digits is not allowed? Solution Here order matters for example 1234 and 1324 are two different numbers. Therefore, there will be as many 4 digit numbers as there are permutations of 9 different digits taken 4 at a time. 9 9! 9! Therefore, the required 4 digit numbers = P4 = =  = 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 = 3024. (9 – 4)! 5! Example 11 How many numbers lying between 100 and 1000 can be formed with the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, if the repetition of the digits is not allowed? Solution Every number between 100 and 1000 is a 3-digit number. We, first, have to 2024-25 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       111 count the permutations of 6 digits taken 3 at a time. This number would be 6P . But, 3 these permutations will include those also where 0 is at the 100’s place. For example, 092, 042, . . ., etc are such numbers which are actually 2-digit numbers and hence the number of such numbers has to be subtracted from 6P to get the required number. To 3 get the number of such numbers, we fix 0 at the 100’s place and rearrange the remaining 5 digits taking 2 at a time. This number is 5P . So 2 6! 5! The required number = 6P 5 3 − P2 = − 3! 3! = 4 × 5 × 6  –  4 ×5 = 100 Example 12 Find the value of n such that n P 5 (i) n 4 P5 = 42 nP3 , n > 4 (ii) = n–1 , n > 4 P4 3 Solution (i) Given that n P5 = 42 nP3 or n (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) (n – 4) = 42 n(n – 1) (n – 2) Since n > 4 so  n(n – 1) (n – 2) ≠ 0 Therefore, by dividing both sides by n(n – 1) (n – 2), we get (n – 3 (n – 4) = 42 or n2  –  7n  –  30 = 0 or n2 – 10n + 3n – 30 or (n – 10) (n + 3) = 0 or n  –  10 = 0 or    n + 3 = 0 or n = 10 or    n =  – 3 As n cannot be  negative, so  n = 10. n P4 5 (ii) Given that = n–1P4 3 Therefore 3n (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) = 5(n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) (n – 4) or 3n = 5 (n – 4) [as (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) ≠ 0, n > 4] or   n = 10. 2024-25 112       MATHEMATICS Example 13 Find r, if  5 4P  = 6 5P  . r r–1 Solution We have 5 4Pr = 6 5Pr −1 4! 5! or 5× = 6× (4 − r )! (5 − r +1)! 5! 6 × 5! or = (4 − r )! (5 − r +1) (5 − r )(5 − r −1)! or (6  –  r) (5  –  r) = 6 or r2  –  11r + 24 = 0 or r2 – 8r – 3r + 24 = 0 or (r  –  8) (r  –  3) = 0 or r = 8   or  r = 3. Hence r = 8, 3. Example 14 Find the number of different  8-letter arrangements that can be made from the letters of the word DAUGHTER so that (i) all vowels occur together (ii) all vowels do not occur together. Solution (i) There are 8 different letters in the word DAUGHTER, in which there are 3 vowels, namely, A, U and E. Since the vowels have to occur together, we can for the time being, assume them as a single object (AUE). This single object together with 5 remaining letters (objects) will be counted as 6 objects. Then we count permutations of these 6 objects taken all at a time. This number would be 6P  = 6!. Corresponding to 6 each of these permutations, we shall have 3! permutations of the three vowels A, U, E taken all at a time . Hence, by the multiplication principle the required number of permutations = 6 ! × 3 ! = 4320. (ii) If we have to count those permutations in which all vowels are never together, we first have to find all possible arrangments of 8 letters taken all  at a time, which can be done in 8! ways. Then, we have to subtract from this number, the number of permutations in which the vowels are always together. Therefore, the required number 8 ! – 6 ! × 3 ! = 6 ! (7×8 – 6) = 2 × 6 ! (28 – 3) = 50 × 6 ! = 50 × 720 = 36000 Example 15 In how many ways can 4 red, 3 yellow and 2 green discs be arranged in a row if the discs of the same colour are indistinguishable ? Solution Total number of discs are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9. Out of 9 discs, 4 are of the first kind 2024-25 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       113 (red), 3 are of the second kind (yellow) and 2 are of the third kind (green). 9! Therefore, the number of arrangements =1260 . 4! 3! 2! Example 16 Find the number of arrangements of the letters of the word INDEPENDENCE. In how many of these arrangements, (i) do the words start with P (ii) do all the vowels always occur together (iii) do the vowels never occur together (iv) do the words begin with I and end in P? Solution There are 12 letters, of which N appears 3 times, E appears 4 times and D appears 2 times and the rest are all different. Therefore 12! The required number of arrangements  = = 1663200 3! 4! 2! (i) Let us fix P at the extreme left position, we, then, count the arrangements of the remaining 11 letters. Therefore, the required number of words starting with P 11! = = 138600 . 3! 2! 4! (ii) There are 5 vowels in the given word, which are 4 Es and 1 I. Since, they have to always occur together, we treat them as a single object EEEEI  for the time being. This single object together with 7 remaining objects will account for 8 objects. These 8 objects, in which there are 3Ns and 2 Ds, can be rearranged in 8! ways. Corresponding to each of these arrangements, the 5 vowels E, E, E, 3! 2! 5! E and I  can be rearranged in  ways. Therefore, by multiplication principle, 4! the required number of arrangements 8! 5! = × = 16800 3! 2! 4! (iii) The required number of arrangements = the total number of arrangements (without any restriction) – the number of arrangements where all the vowels occur together. 2024-25 114       MATHEMATICS = 1663200 – 16800  = 1646400 (iv) Let us fix I and P at the extreme ends (I at the left end and P at the right end). We are left with 10 letters. Hence, the required number of arrangements 10! = = 12600 3! 2! 4! EXERCISE 6.3 1.

A team consisting of 2 players is to be formed. In how many ways can we do so? Is the team of X and Y different from the team of Y and X ? Here, order is not important. In fact, there are only 3 possible ways in which the team could be constructed. 2024-25 PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS       115 Fig. 6.3 These are XY, YZ and ZX (Fig 6.3). Here, each selection is called a combination of 3 different objects taken 2 at a time. In a combination, the order is not important. Now consider some more illustrations. Twelve persons meet in a room and each shakes hand with all the others. How do we determine the number of hand shakes. X shaking hands with Y and  Y with X will not be two different hand shakes. Here, order is not important. There will be as many hand shakes as there are combinations of 12 different things taken 2 at a time. Seven points lie on a circle. How many chords can be drawn by joining these points pairwise? There will be as many chords as there are combinations of 7 different things taken 2 at a time. Now, we obtain the formula for finding the number of combinations of n different objects taken r at a time, denoted by nC .. r Suppose we have 4 different objects A, B, C and D. Taking 2 at a time, if we have to make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here,  AB and BA are the same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not included BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations of 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., 4C  = 6. 2 Corresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as 2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of permutations = 4C  × 2!. 2 On the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at a time = 4P . 2 4! 4 Therefore 4P  = 4C  × 2!   or   = C 2 2 (4 − 2) 2 ! 2! Now, let us suppose that we have 5 different objects A, B, C, D, E. Taking 3 at a time, if we have to make combinations, these will be ABC, ABD, ABE, BCD, BCE, CDE, ACE, ACD, ADE, BDE. Corresponding to each of these 5C  combinations, there 3 are 3! permutations, because, the three objects in each combination can be 2024-25 116       MATHEMATICS rearranged in 3 ! ways. Therefore, the total of permutations = 5 C3 × 3! 5! 5 Therefore       5P  = 5C  × 3!    or = C (5 − 3) 3 3 3 ! 3! These examples suggest the following theorem showing relationship between permutaion and combination: Theorem 5 n P nC 0 r n r = < ≤
