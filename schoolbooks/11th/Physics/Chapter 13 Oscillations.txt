CHAPTER THIRTEEN OSCILLATIONS 13.1 INTRODUCTION In our daily life we come across various kinds of motions. You have already learnt about some of them, e.g., rectilinear 13.1 Introduction motion and motion of a projectile. Both these motions are 13.2 Periodic and oscillatory non-repetitive. We have also learnt about uniform circular motions motion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In 13.3 Simple harmonic motion these cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of 13.4 Simple harmonic motion time, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have and uniform circular enjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both motion these motions are repetitive in nature but different from the 13.5 Velocity and acceleration periodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro in simple harmonic motion about a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes 13.6 Force law for simple a similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro harmonic motion motion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river, the 13.7 Energy in simple harmonic piston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a motion motion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we 13.8 The simple pendulum study this motion. Summary The study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its Points to ponder Exercises concepts are required for the understanding of many physical phenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar or the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce pleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms in telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about their mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make the propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate about their equilibrium positions, the average energy of vibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power supply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive and negative about the mean value (zero). The description of a periodic motion, in general, and oscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental concepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude and phase. These concepts are developed in the next section. 2024-25 260 PHYSICS 13.2 PERIODIC AND OSCILLATORY MOTIONS Very often, the body undergoing periodic Fig. 13.1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose motion has an equilibrium position somewhere an insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it inside its path. When the body is at this position comes back to the initial point and repeats the no net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is left there at rest, it remains there forever. If the process identically. If you draw a graph of its body is given a small displacement from the height above the ground versus time, it would position, a force comes into play which tries to look something like Fig. 13.1 (a). If a child climbs bring the body back to the equilibrium point, up a step, comes down, and repeats the process giving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For identically, its height above the ground would example, a ball placed in a bowl will be in look like that in Fig. 13.1 (b). When you play the equilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little game of bouncing a ball off the ground, between from the point, it will perform oscillations in the your palm and the ground, its height versus time bowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but graph would look like the one in Fig. 13.1 (c). every periodic motion need not be oscillatory. Note that both the curved parts in Fig. 13.1 (c) Circular motion is a periodic motion, but it is are sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s not oscillatory. equation of motion (see section 2.6), There is no significant difference between 1 oscillations and vibrations. It seems that when h = ut + gt 2 for downward motion, and 2 the frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like, the oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when 1 h = ut – gt 2 for upward motion, the frequency is high, we call it vibration (like, 2 the vibration of a string of a musical instrument). with different values of u in each case. These Simple harmonic motion is the simplest form are examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion of oscillatory motion. This motion arises when that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is the force on the oscillating body is directly called periodic motion. proportional to its displacement from the mean position, which is also the equilibrium position. Further, at any point in its oscillation, this force is directed towards the mean position. In practice, oscillating bodies eventually (a) come to rest at their equilibrium positions because of the damping due to friction and other dissipative causes.  However, they can be forced to remain oscillating by means of some external periodic agency.  We discuss the phenomena of damped and forced oscillations later in the chapter. Any material medium can be pictured as a (b) collection of a large number of coupled oscillators. The collective oscillations of the constituents of a medium manifest themselves as waves. Examples of waves include water waves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves. We shall study the wave phenomenon in the next chapter. (c) 13.2.1 Period and frequency We have seen that any motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic motion. The smallest interval of time after which the motion is repeated is called its Fig. 13.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T period. Let us denote the period by the symbol is shown in each case. T. Its SI unit is second.

The of seconds, other convenient units of time are term displacement is not always to be referred used. The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal is expressed in units of microseconds (10–6 s) abbreviated as µs. On the other hand, the orbital period of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days. The Halley’s comet appears after every 76 years. The reciprocal of T gives the number of repetitions that occur per unit time. This quantity is called the frequency of the periodic motion. It is represented by the symbol ν. The relation between ν and T is Fig. 13.2(a) A block attached to a spring, the other ν  = 1/T  (13.1) end of which is fixed to a rigid wall. The block moves on a frictionless surface. The The unit of ν is thus s–1. After the discoverer of motion of the block can be described in radio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857–1894), terms of its distance or displacement x a special name has been given to the unit of from the equilibrium position. frequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz). Thus, 1 hertz  = 1 Hz =1 oscillation per second =1 s–1 (13.2) Note, that the frequency, ν, is not necessarily an integer. u Example 13.1  On an average, a human heart is found to beat 75 times in a minute.

In the propagation of sound wave, the changing this chapter, we use the term displacement electric and magnetic fields in a light wave are in a more general sense. It refers to change examples of displacement in different contexts. with time of any physical property under The displacement variable may take both consideration. For example, in case of rectilinear positive and negative values. In experiments on motion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance oscillations, the displacement is measured for from the starting point as a function of time is different times. The displacement can be represented by a its position displacement. The choice of origin mathematical function of time. In case of periodic is a matter of convenience. Consider a block motion, this function is periodic in time. One of attached to a spring, the other end of the spring the simplest periodic functions is given by is fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig.13.2(a)]. Generally, it is convenient to measure displacement of the     f (t) = A cos ωt (13.3a) body from its equilibrium position. For an If the argument of this function, ωt, is oscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the increased by an integral multiple of 2π radians, vertical as a function of time may be regarded the value of the function remains the same. The 2024-25 262 PHYSICS function f (t ) is then periodic and its period, T, (ii) This is an example of a periodic motion. It is given by can be noted that each term represents a 2π periodic function with a different angular T =     (13.3b) frequency.

Taking, (iii) The function e–ωt is not periodic, it decreases monotonically with increasing A = D cos φ  and  B = D sin φ time and tends to zero as t → ∞ and thus, Eq.

This oscillatory superposition of sine and cosine functions motion is said to be simple harmonic if the of different time periods with suitable displacement x of the particle from the origin coefficients. varies with time as : x (t) = A cos (ω t + φ ) (13.4) u Example 13.2   Which of the following functions of time represent (a) periodic and (b) non-periodic motion?

The quantities A, 2024-25 OSCILLATIONS 263 any loss of generality]. As the cosine function of time varies from +1 to –1, the displacement varies between the extremes A and – A. Two simple harmonic motions may have same ω and φ but different amplitudes A and B, as shown in Fig. 13.7 (a). While the amplitude A is fixed for a given SHM, the state of motion (position and velocity) of the particle at any time t is determined by the Fig. 13.4 The location of the particle in SHM at the discrete values t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4, T, 5T/4. The time after which motion repeats itself is T. T will remain fixed, no matter what location you choose as the initial (t = Fig. 13.7 (a) A plot of displacement as a function of 0) location.

If the amplitude is known, φ can be determined from the displacement at t = 0. Two simple harmonic motions may have the same A and ω but different phase angle φ, as shown in Fig. 13.7 (b). Finally, the quantity ω can be seen to be related to the period of motion T. Taking, for simplicity, φ = 0 in Eq.

That is, (b) sin2 ωt = ½ – ½ cos 2 ωt A cos ωt = A cos ω (t + T )      (13.6) The function is periodic having a period Now the cosine function is periodic with period T = π/ω. It also represents a harmonic 2π, i.e., it first repeats itself when the argument motion with the point of equilibrium changes by 2π. Therefore, occurring at ½ instead of zero.                      ⊳ ω(t + T ) = ωt + 2π 13.4  SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION that is ω = 2π/ T (13.7) In this section, we show that the projection of uniform circular motion on a diameter of the ω is called the angular frequency of SHM. Its circle follows simple harmonic motion. A S.I. unit is radians per second.

Observe the frequency of the curve (a). ball sideways or from the front, fixing your attention in the plane of motion. The ball will appear to execute to and fro motion along a horizontal line with the point of rotation as the midpoint. You could alternatively observe the shadow of the ball on a wall which is perpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this process what we are observing is the motion of the ball on a diameter of the circle normal to the direction of viewing. Fig. 13.8   Plots of Eq.

Obtain the simple harmonic motions of the x-projection of the radius vector of the rotating particle P in each case. Fig. 13.10 will make an angle of ωt + φ with the +ve x-axis. Next, consider the projection of the position vector OP on the x-axis. This will be Answer OP′.

Angle is a dimensionless quantity. Therefore it is not always necessary to mention the unit ‘radian’ when we use π, its multiples or submultiples. The conversion between radian and degree is not similar to that between metre and centimetre or mile. If the argument of a trigonometric function is stated without units, it is understood that the unit is radian. On the other hand, if degree is to be used as the unit of angle, then it must be shown explicitly. For example, sin(150) means sine of 15 degree, but sin(15) means sine of 15 radians. Hereafter, we will often drop ‘rad’ as the unit, and it should be understood that whenever angle is mentioned as a numerical value, without units, it is to be taken as radians. 2024-25 266 PHYSICS (b) In this case at t = 0, OP makes an angle of where the negative sign shows that v (t) has a direction opposite to the positive direction of 90o = π  with the x-axis.

We know that the = B sin    t T  centripetal acceleration of a particle P in uniform For T = 30 s, circular motion has a magnitude v2/A or ω2A, and it is directed towards the centre i.e., the x(t) = B sin  π  t direction is along PO.

We find that this                = –ω2x (t) (13.11) represents a SHM of amplitude B, period 30 s, and an initial phase of − π . ⊳ 2 13.5 VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION IN SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION The speed of a particle v in uniform circular motion is its angular speed ω times the radius of the circle A. v = ω A      (13.8) The direction of velocity v at a time t is along the tangent to the circle at the point where the particle is located at that instant. From the geometry of Fig. 13.11, it is clear that the velocity Fig. 13.12 The acceleration, a(t), of the particle P′ is the projection of the acceleration a of the of the projection particle P′ at time t is reference particle P. v(t ) = –ωA sin (ωt + φ )              (13.9) Eq. (13.11) gives the acceleration of a particle in SHM. The same equation can again be obtained directly by differentiating velocity v(t) given by Eq. (13.9) with respect to time: d a(t ) = v(t ) (13.12) dt We note from Eq. (13.11) the important Fig. 13.11 The velocity, v (t), of the particle P′ is property that acceleration of a particle in SHM the projection of the velocity v of the is proportional to displacement. For x(t) > 0, reference particle, P. a(t) < 0 and for  x(t) < 0, a(t) > 0. Thus, whatever 2024-25 OSCILLATIONS 267 the value of x between –A and A, the acceleration (b) Using Eq.

To summarise the discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can be defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq. (13.4) for displacement or by Eq. (13.13) that gives Fig. 13.13 Displacement, velocity and acceleration of its force law. Going from Eq. (13.4) to Eq. (13.13) a particle in simple harmonic motion have required us to differentiate two times. Likewise, the same period T, but they differ in phase by integrating the force law Eq. (13.13) two times, we can get back Eq. (13.4). u Example 13.5  A body oscillates with SHM Note that the force in Eq. (13.13) is linearly according to the equation (in SI units), proportional to x(t). A particle oscillating under x = 5 cos [2π t + π/4]. such a force is, therefore, calling a linear harmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force At t = 1.5 s, calculate the (a) displacement, may contain small additional terms proportional (b) speed and (c) acceleration of the body. to x2, x3, etc. These then are called non-linear oscillators.

The executing simple harmonic motion is also time period of oscillations is, periodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean m position and maximum at the extreme T = 2π displacements. 2k ⊳ 2024-25 OSCILLATIONS 269 It follows from Eqs.

The block is oscillator is thus independent of time as pulled to a distance x = 10 cm from its expected for motion under any conservative equilibrium position at x = 0 on a frictionless surface from rest at t = 0. Calculate the force. The time and displacement dependence kinetic, potential and total energies of the of the potential and kinetic energies of a block when it is 5 cm away from the mean linear simple harmonic oscillator are shown position. in Fig. 13.16. Answer The block executes SHM, its angular frequency, as given by Eq. (13.14b), is k ω = m – 1 50 N m = 1kg = 7.07 rad s–1 Its displacement at any time t is then given by, x(t) = 0.1 cos (7.07t) Fig. 13.16 Kinetic energy, potential energy and total energy as a function of time [shown in (a)] Therefore, when the particle is 5 cm away from and displacement [shown in (b)] of a particle in SHM. The kinetic energy and potential the mean position, we have energy both repeat after a period T/2. The total energy remains constant at all t or x. 0.05 = 0.1 cos (7.07t) 2024-25 270 PHYSICS Or cos (7.07t) = 0.5 and hence let it go. The stone executes a to and fro motion, it is periodic with a period of about two seconds. 3 We shall show that this periodic motion is sin (7.07t)  =  = 0.866 2 simple harmonic for small displacements from Then, the velocity of the block at x = 5 cm is = 0.1 × 7.07 × 0.866 m s–1 = 0.61 m s–1 Hence the K.E. of the block, 1 =  m v2 2 = ½[1kg × (0.6123 m s–1 )2 ] = 0.19 J (a) The P.E. of the block, 1 =  k x2 2 = ½(50 N m–1 × 0.05 m × 0.05 m) = 0.0625 J The total energy of the block at x = 5 cm, =  K.E. + P.E. =  0.25 J we also know that at maximum displacement, K.E. is zero and hence the total energy of the  (b) system is equal to the P.E. Therefore, the total Fig. 13.17 (a) A bob oscillating about its mean position. (b) The radial force T-mg cosθ energy of the system, provides centripetal force but no torque about the support. The tangential force = ½(50 N m–1 ×  0.1 m × 0.1 m ) mg sinθ provides the restoring torque. = 0.25 J which is same as the sum of the two energies at the mean position. Consider simple pendulum a displacement of 5 cm. This is in conformity — a small bob of mass m tied to an inextensible with the principle of conservation of energy.  ⊳ massless string of length L. The other end of 13.8 The Simple Pendulum the string is fixed to a rigid support.
