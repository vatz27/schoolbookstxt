It Points to ponder gives a molecular interpretation of  pressure and temperature Exercises of a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and Avogadro’s hypothesis. It correctly explains specific heat capacities of many gases. It also relates measurable properties of gases such as viscosity, conduction and diffusion with molecular parameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses. This chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory. 12.2 MOLECULAR NATURE OF MATTER Richard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century considers the discovery that “Matter is made up of atoms” to be a very significant one. Humanity may suffer annihilation (due to nuclear catastrophe) or extinction (due to environmental disasters) if we do not act wisely. If that happens, and all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed then Feynman would like the ‘Atomic Hypothesis’ to be communicated to the next generation of creatures in the universe. Atomic Hypothesis: All things are made of atoms little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. Speculation that matter may not be continuous, existed in many places and cultures. Kanada in India and Democritus 2024-25 KINETIC THEORY 245 Atomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece Though John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in ancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules.  In the Vaiseshika school of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in considerable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter. It was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a mustard seed and the Meru mountain.  The four kinds of atoms (Paramanu — Sanskrit word for the smallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic mass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and was continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a diatomic molecule dvyanuka, three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending upon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms.  The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjecture or by methods that are not known to us.  The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the Buddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic size, of the order of 10 –10 m. In ancient Greece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The word ‘atom’ means ‘indivisible’ in Greek. According to him, atoms differ from each other physically, in shape, size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed by their combination.  The atoms of water were smooth and round and unable to ‘hook’ on to each other, which is why liquid /water flows easily.   The atoms of earth were rough and jagged, so they held together to form hard substances.  The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns. These fascinating ideas, despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further, perhaps because they were intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments - the hallmark of modern science. in Greece had suggested that matter may consist of matter. The theory is now well accepted by of indivisible constituents. The scientific ‘Atomic scientists. However even at the end of the Theory’  is usually credited to John Dalton. He nineteenth century there were famous scientists proposed the atomic  theory to explain the laws who did not believe in atomic theory ! of definite and multiple proportions obeyed by From many observations, in recent times we elements when they combine into compounds. now know that  molecules (made up of one or The first law says that any given compound has, more atoms) constitute matter. Electron a fixed proportion by mass of its constituents. microscopes  and scanning tunnelling The second law says that when two elements microscopes enable us to even see them. The form more than one compound, for a fixed mass size of an atom is about an angstrom (10 -10   m). of one element, the masses of the other elements In solids, which are tightly packed, atoms are are in ratio of small integers. spaced about a few  angstroms (2 Å) apart. In To explain the laws Dalton suggested, about liquids the separation between atoms is also 200 years ago,  that the smallest constituents about the same.  In liquids the atoms  are not of an element are atoms. Atoms of one element as rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move are identical but differ from those of other around. This enables a liquid to flow.  In gases elements.  A small number of atoms of each the interatomic distances are in tens of element combine to form a molecule of the angstroms.  The average distance a molecule compound. Gay Lussac’s law, also given in early can travel without colliding is called the  mean 19th century, states:  When gases combine free path. The mean free path, in gases, is of chemically to yield another gas, their volumes the order of thousands of angstroms. The atoms are in the ratios of small integers.  Avogadro’s are much freer in gases and can travel long law  (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all distances without colliding. If they are not gases at equal temperature and pressure have enclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and the same number of molecules.  Avogadro’s law, liquids the closeness makes the interatomic force when combined with Dalton’s theory explains important. The force has a long range attraction Gay  Lussac’s law.  Since the elements are often and a short range repulsion. The atoms attract in the form of molecules, Dalton’s atomic theory when they are at a few angstroms but repel when can also be referred to as the molecular theory they come closer. The static appearance of a gas 2024-25 246 PHYSICS is misleading. The gas is full of activity and the is 6.02 × 1023. This is known as Avogadro number equilibrium is a dynamic one. In dynamic and is denoted by NA. The mass of 22.4 litres of equilibrium, molecules collide and change their any gas is equal to its molecular weight in grams speeds during the collision. Only the average at S.T.P (standard temperature 273 K and properties are constant. pressure 1 atm). This amount of substance is Atomic theory is not the end of our quest, but called a mole (see Chapter 1 for a more precise the beginning. We now know that atoms are not definition). Avogadro had guessed the equality of indivisible or elementary. They consist of a numbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed nucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made temperature and pressure from chemical up of protons and neutrons. The protons and reactions.  Kinetic  theory justifies this hypothesis. neutrons are again made up of quarks. Even The perfect gas equation can be written as quarks may not be the end of the story. There may be string like elementary entities. Nature PV = µ RT (12.3) always has surprises for us, but the search for where  µ   is the number of moles and R  = NA truth is often enjoyable and the discoveries kB is a universal constant. The temperature T is beautiful. In this chapter, we shall limit ourselves absolute temperature.  Choosing kelvin scale for absolute temperature, R = 8.314 J mol–1K–1 to understanding the behaviour of gases (and a . little bit of solids), as a collection of moving Here molecules in incessant motion. µ = M = N (12.4) M0 NA 12.3   BEHAVIOUR OF GASES where M is the mass of the gas containing N Properties of gases are easier to understand than molecules, M0 is the molar mass and NA the those of solids and liquids.

Gases at low pressures and high temperatures much above that at which they liquefy (or solidify) approximately satisfy a simple relation between their pressure, temperature and volume given by (see Chapter 10) PV = KT (12.1) for a given sample of the gas. Here T is the temperature in kelvin or (absolute)  scale. K is  a constant for the given sample but varies with the volume of the gas. If we now  bring in  the idea of atoms or molecules, then K is proportional to the number of molecules, (say) N in the sample. We can write K = N k . Observation tells P (atm) us that this k is same for all gases.

An ideal gas is a simple theoretical PV = ( µ1 + µ2 +…  ) RT (12.7) model of a gas. No real gas is truly ideal.

Without interactions present. This is called the partial pressure of the the gas behaves like an ideal one. gas. Thus, the total pressure of a mixture of ideal If we fix µ and T in Eq. (12.3), we get gases is the sum of partial pressures. This is PV = constant (12.6) Dalton’s law of partial pressures. i.e., keeping temperature constant, pressure of a given mass of gas varies inversely with volume. This is the famous Boyle’s law. Fig. 12.2  shows comparison between experimental P-V curves and the theoretical curves predicted by Boyle’s law. Once again you see that the  agreement is good at high temperatures and  low pressures. Next, if you fix P, Eq. (12.1) shows that V ∝  T i.e., for a fixed pressure, the volume of a gas is proportional to its absolute temperature T (Charles’ law). See Fig. 12.3. Fig. 12.3 Experimental T-V curves (solid lines) for CO 2 at three pressures compared with Charles’ law (dotted lines). T is in units of 300 K and V in units of 0.13 litres. We next consider some examples which give us information about the volume occupied by the molecules and the volume of a single molecule. Example 12.1 The density of water is  1000 kg m–3. The density of water vapour at 100 °C and 1 atm pressure is 0.6 kg m–3.

Use the data given in 12.4 KINETIC THEORY OF AN IDEAL GAS Examples 12.1 and 12.2. Kinetic theory of gases is based on the molecular picture of matter. A given amount of gas is a Answer :   A given mass of water in vapour state collection of a large number of molecules has 1.67×103 times the volume of the same mass (typically of the order of Avogadro’s number) that of water in liquid state (Ex. 12.1). This is also are in incessant random motion. At ordinary the increase in the amount of volume available pressure and temperature, the average distance for each molecule of water. When volume between molecules is a factor of 10 or more than increases by 103 times the radius increases by the typical size of a molecule (2 Å). Thus, V1/3 or 10 times, i.e., 10 × 2 Å  = 20 Å. So the interaction between molecules is negligible and average distance is 2 × 20 = 40  Å.     ⊳ we can assume that they move freely in straight lines according to Newton’s first law. However, Example 12.4 A vessel contains two non- occasionally, they come close to each other, reactive gases : neon (monatomic) and experience intermolecular forces and their oxygen (diatomic).

Thus P = (1/3) n m v2 (12.14) Some remarks on this derivation. First, though we choose the container to be a cube, the shape of the vessel really is immaterial. For a vessel of arbitrary shape, we can always choose a small infinitesimal (planar) area and carry through the steps above. Notice that both A and ∆t do not appear in the final result. By Pascal’s law, given in Ch. 9,  pressure in one portion of Fig. 12.4 Elastic collision of a gas molecule with the the gas  in equilibrium is the same as anywhere wall of the container. else. Second, we have ignored any collisions in To calculate the force (and pressure) on the the derivation.

At a Equation (13.14) can be written as temperature T = 300 K, the mean square speed PV   =  (1/3) nV m v2 (12.15a) of a molecule in nitrogen gas is : PV   =   (2/3) N x ½ m v2 (12.15b) M N where N (= nV ) is the number of molecules in 2 28 m = = = 4.65 ×10–26 26  kg. the sample.

E = N × (1/2) m v2 (12.16) vrms   =    516 m s-1 Equation (12.15) then gives : The speed is of the order of the speed of sound PV = (2/3) E (12.17) in air. It follows from Eq. (12.19) that at the same We are now ready for a kinetic interpretation temperature, lighter molecules have greater rms of temperature. Combining Eq. (12.17) with the speed. ideal gas Eq.
