CHAPTER EIGHT MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 8.1 INTRODUCTION In Chapter 6, we studied the rotation of the bodies and then realised that the motion of a body depends on how mass is 8.1 Introduction distributed within the body.  We restricted ourselves to simpler 8.2 Stress and strain situations of rigid bodies.  A rigid body generally means a 8.3 Hooke’s law hard solid object having a definite shape and size.  But in 8.4 Stress-strain curve reality,  bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even 8.5 Elastic moduli the  appreciably  rigid  steel bar can be deformed when a 8.6 Applications of elastic sufficiently large external force is applied on it.  This means behaviour of materials that solid bodies are not perfectly rigid. A solid has  definite shape and size. In order to change (or Summary deform) the shape or size of a body, a force  is required. If Points to ponder you stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the Exercises length of the spring increases slightly. When you leave the ends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape.  The property of a body, by virtue of  which  it tends to regain its original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is known as elasticity and the deformation caused is known as elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump of putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their previous shape, and they get permanently deformed. Such substances are called plastic and this property is called plasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics. The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role in engineering design.  For example, while designing a building, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel, concrete etc. is essential.  The same is true in the design of bridges, automobiles, ropeways etc.  One could also ask  — Can we design an aeroplane which is very  light  but sufficiently  strong?  Can we design an artificial limb which is lighter but stronger?  Why does a railway track have a particular shape  like I?  Why  is glass brittle while brass is not?  Answers to such questions begin with the study of how relatively  simple kinds of loads or forces act to deform different solids bodies.  In this chapter, we  shall study the 2024-25 168 PHYSICS elastic behaviour and mechanical properties of ∆L solids which would answer many such Longitudinal strain  = (8.2) questions. L However, if two equal and opposite  deforming 8.2  STRESS AND STRAIN forces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional When  forces are applied on a body in such a area of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 8.1(b), manner that the body is still in static equilibrium, there is relative displacement between the it is deformed to a small or large extent depending opposite faces of the cylinder.

The tangential force is known as tangential or deformation may not be noticeable visually in shearing stress. many materials but it is there. When a body is As a result of applied tangential force, there subjected to a deforming force, a restoring force is a relative displacement ∆x between opposite is developed in the body. This restoring force is faces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 8.1(b). equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to The strain so produced is known as shearing the applied force. The restoring force per unit area strain and it is defined as the ratio of relative is known as stress.  If F is the force applied normal displacement of the faces ∆x  to the length of the to the cross–section and A  is the  area of cross cylinder L. section of  the body, Magnitude of the stress = F/A (8.1) Shearing strain = ∆x = tan θ (8.3) The SI unit of stress is  N m–2 or pascal (Pa) L and its dimensional formula is [ ML–1T–2 ]. where θ is the angular displacement of the There are three ways in which a solid may cylinder from the vertical (original position of the change its dimensions when an external force cylinder). Usually  θ is very small, tan θ acts on it. These are shown in Fig. 8.1. In is nearly equal to angle θ, (if θ = 10°, for Fig.8.1(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal example, there is only 1% difference between θ forces applied normal to its cross-sectional area. and tan θ). The restoring force per unit area  in this case is It can also be visualised, when a book is called tensile stress. If the cylinder is pressed with the hand and pushed horizontally, compressed under the action of applied forces, as shown in Fig. 8.2 (c). the restoring force per unit area is known as Thus, shearing strain  = tan θ ≈ θ (8.4) compressive stress. Tensile or compressive In Fig. 8.1 (d), a solid sphere placed in the fluid stress can also be termed as longitudinal stress. under high pressure is compressed uniformly on In both the cases, there is a change in the all sides. The force applied by the fluid acts in length of the cylinder. The change in the length perpendicular direction at each point of the ∆L to the original length L of the body (cylinder surface and the body is said to be under in this case) is known as longitudinal strain. hydraulic compression. This leads to decrease (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 8.1 (a) A cylindrical body under tensile stress elongates by ∆L (b) Shearing stress on a cylinder deforming it by an angle θ (c) A body subjected to shearing stress (d) A solid body under a stress normal to the surface at every point (hydraulic stress).

The stress-strain curves vary from The body develops internal restoring forces material to material. These curves help us to that are equal and opposite to the forces applied understand how a given material deforms with by the fluid (the body restores its original shape increasing loads. From the graph, we can see and size when taken out from the fluid). The that in the region between O to A, the curve is internal restoring force per unit area in this case linear.  In this region, Hooke’s law is obeyed. is known as hydraulic stress and in magnitude The body regains its original dimensions when is equal to the hydraulic pressure (applied force the applied force is removed. In this region, the per unit area). solid behaves as an elastic body. The strain produced by a hydraulic pressure is called volume strain and is defined as the ratio of change in volume (∆V) to the original volume (V ). Volume strain = ∆V (8.5) V Since the strain is a ratio of change in dimension to the original dimension, it has no units or dimensional formula. 8.3  HOOKE’S LAW Stress and strain take different forms in the situations depicted in the Fig. (8.1). For small deformations the stress and strain are proportional to each other. This is known as Fig. 8.2 A typical stress-strain curve for a metal. Hooke’s law. Thus, In the region from A to B, stress and strain stress ∝ strain are not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still stress = k × strain (8.6) returns to its original dimension when the load where k is the proportionality constant and is is removed. The point B in the curve is known known as modulus of elasticity. as yield point (also known as elastic limit) and Hooke’s law is an empirical law and is found the corresponding stress is known as yield to be valid for most materials. However, there strength (σ ) of the material. y are some materials which do not exhibit this If the load is increased further, the stress linear relationship. developed exceeds the yield strength and strain increases rapidly even for a small change in the 8.4  STRESS-STRAIN CURVE stress. The portion of the curve between B and D shows this. When the load is removed, say at The relation between the stress and the strain some point C between B and D, the body does for a given material under tensile stress can be not regain its original dimension. In this case, found experimentally. In a standard test of even when the stress is zero, the strain is not tensile properties, a test cylinder or a wire is zero.

The point D on the graph is the force needed to cause the strain are recorded. ultimate tensile strength (σ ) of the material. The applied force is gradually increased in steps u Beyond this point, additional strain is produced and the change in length is noted. A graph is even by a reduced applied force and fracture plotted between the stress (which is equal in occurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and magnitude to the applied force per unit area) and fracture points D and E are close, the material the strain produced. A typical graph for a metal is said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the is shown in Fig. 8.2. Analogous graphs for material is said to be ductile. 2024-25 170 PHYSICS 8.5  ELASTIC MODULI The proportional region within the elastic limit of the stress-strain curve (region OA in Fig. 8.2) is of great importance for structural and manufacturing engineering designs. The ratio of stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity, is found to be a characteristic of the material. 8.5.1  Young’s Modulus Experimental observation show that for a given material, the magnitude of the strain produced is same whether the stress is tensile or compressive. The ratio of tensile (or compressive) stress (σ) to the longitudinal strain (ε) is defined as Fig. 8.3 Stress-strain curve for the elastic tissue of Young’s modulus and is denoted by the symbol Y. Aorta, the large tube (vessel) carrying blood from the heart. σ Y = ε (8.7) As stated earlier, the stress-strain behaviour varies from material to material. For example, From Eqs.

This leads to the decrease in the volume of the body thus producing a strain called Aluminium 72 volume strain [Eq. (8.5)]. The ratio of hydraulic Brass 61 stress to the corresponding hydraulic strain is called bulk modulus. It is denoted by symbol B. Copper 140 B = – p/(∆V/V) (8.12) Glass 37 The negative sign indicates the fact that with Iron 100 an increase in pressure, a decrease in volume occurs. That is, if p is positive, ∆V is negative.

From rope to which the load is attached. The rope is Eq. (8.16), we see that to reduce the bending pulled up using pulleys and motors. Suppose we for a given load, one should use a material with want to make a crane, which has a lifting a large Young’s modulus Y. For a given material, capacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1 metric increasing the depth d rather than the breadth ton = 1000 kg). How thick should the steel rope b is more effective in reducing the bending, since be? We obviously want that the load does not δ  is proportional to d -3 and only to b-1(of course deform the rope permanently. Therefore, the the length l of the span should be as small as extension should not exceed the elastic limit. From Table 8.1, we find that mild steel has a possible). But on increasing the depth, unless yield strength (σ ) of about 300 × 106 N m–2. Thus, the load is exactly at the right place (difficult to y the area of cross-section (A) of the rope should arrange in a bridge with moving traffic), the at least be deep bar  may bend as shown in Fig. 8.7(b). This A ≥ W/σy  =  Mg/σy (8.15) is called buckling. To avoid this, a common =  (104 kg × 9.8 m s-2)/(300 × 106 N m-2) compromise is the cross-sectional shape shown =  3.3 × 10-4 m2 in Fig. 8.7(c). This section provides a large loadcorresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for a bearing surface and enough depth to prevent rope of circular cross-section. Generally a bending. This shape reduces the weight of the large margin of safety (of about a factor of ten beam without sacrificing the strength and in the load) is provided. Thus a thicker rope of hence reduces the cost. radius about 3 cm is recommended. A single wire of this radius would practically be a rigid rod. So the ropes are always made of a number of thin wires braided together, like in pigtails, for ease in manufacture, flexibility and strength. A bridge has to be designed such that it can withstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force of winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the design of buildings the use of beams and columns is very common. In both the cases, the overcoming of the problem of bending of beam under a load is of prime importance. The beam should not bend too much or break. Let us consider the case of a beam loaded at the centre and supported near its ends as shown in Fig. 8.6.

A pillar with rounded ends as shown in Fig. 8.9(a) supports less load than that with a distributed shape at the ends [Fig. 8.9(b)].

The stress due to all the material on the top should be less than the critical shearing stress at which the rocks flow. At the bottom of a mountain of height h, the force per unit area due to the weight of the mountain is hρg where ρ is the density of the material of the mountain and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The material at the bottom experiences this force in the vertical direction, and the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore, this is not a case of pressure or bulk compression. (a)                         (b) There is a shear component, approximately hρg Fig. 8.8 Pillars or columns: (a) a pillar with rounded itself.

A mountain base is not under       = 10 km uniform compression and this provides some which is more than the height of Mt. Everest! SUMMARY 1. Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension. In general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress — longitudinal stress (associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression), (b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress. 2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials. This is known as Hooke’s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of elasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus are used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces that act on them. A class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke’s law. 3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke’s law takes the form F/A  = Y∆L/L where  ∆L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is the magnitude of the applied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied (perpendicular to A) and Y is the Young’s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A. 4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so that the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement ∆L of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is called shear and the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is possible only in solids. In this kind of deformation the Hooke’s law takes the form F/A = G × ∆L/L where ∆L is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force F, and G is the shear modulus. 5. When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding fluid, the Hooke’s law takes the form p = B (∆V/V), where p is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the fluid, ∆V/V  (the volume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object’s volume due to that pressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object. 2024-25 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 177 POINTS TO PONDER 1. In the case of a wire, suspended from celing and stretched under the action of a weight (F) suspended from its other end, the force exerted by the ceiling on it is  equal and opposite to the weight. However, the tension at any cross-section A of the wire is just F and not 2F. Hence, tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to F/A. 2. Hooke’s law is valid only in the linear part of stress-strain curve. 3. The Young’s modulus and shear modulus are relevant only for solids since only solids have lengths and shapes. 4. Bulk modulus is relevant for solids, liquid and gases.  It refers to the change in volume when every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body remains unchanged. 5. Metals have larger values of Young’s modulus than alloys and elastomers. A material with large value of Young’s modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in its length. 6. In daily life, we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic, but it a is misnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered to be more elastic. 7. In general, a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions also. The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described by just one elastic constant.  For example, for a wire under longitudinal strain, the lateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change, which is described by another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio). 8. Stress is not a vector quantity since, unlike a force, the stress cannot be assigned a specific direction. Force acting on the portion of a body on a specified side of a section has a definite direction.
