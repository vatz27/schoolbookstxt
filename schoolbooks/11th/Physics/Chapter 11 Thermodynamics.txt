CHAPTER ELEVEN THERMODYNAMICS 11.1  INTRODUCTION In previous chapter we have studied thermal properties of matter. In this chapter we shall study laws that govern thermal energy. We shall study the processes where work is 11.1 Introduction converted into heat and vice versa. In winter, when we rub 11.2 Thermal equilibrium our palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing 11.3 Zeroth law of produces the  ‘heat’.  Conversely, in a steam engine, the ‘heat’ Thermodynamics of the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons, 11.4 Heat, internal energy and which in turn rotate the wheels of the train. work In physics, we need to define the notions of heat, 11.5 First law of temperature, work, etc. more carefully.  Historically, it took a thermodynamics long time to arrive at the proper concept of ‘heat’. Before the 11.6 Specific heat capacity modern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid 11.7 Thermodynamic state filling in the pores of a substance.  On contact between a hot variables and equation of body and a cold body, the fluid  (called caloric) flowed from state the colder to the hotter body ! This is similar to what happens 11.8 Thermodynamic processes when a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water 11.9 Second law of up to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of thermodynamics water in the two tanks are the same.  Likewise, in the ‘caloric’ 11.10 Reversible and irreversible picture of heat, heat flows until the ‘caloric levels’ (i.e., the processes temperatures) equalise. 11.11 Carnot engine In time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in favour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An Summary important experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin Points to ponder Thomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He Exercises observed that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of heat, indeed enough to boil water. More significantly, the amount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the horses employed for turning the drill) but not on the sharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill would scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this was not observed. A most natural explanation of the observations was that heat was a form of energy and the experiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form to another–from work to heat. 2024-25 THERMODYNAMICS 227 Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that in a different context : we say the state of a system deals with the concepts of heat and temperature is an equilibrium state if the macroscopic and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms variables that characterise the system do not of energy. Thermodynamics is a macroscopic change in time. For example, a gas inside a closed science. It deals with bulk systems and does not rigid container, completely insulated from its go into the molecular constitution of matter. In surroundings, with fixed values of pressure, fact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the volume, temperature, mass and composition that nineteenth century before the molecular picture do not change with time, is in a state of of matter was firmly established.  Thermodynamic thermodynamic equilibrium. description involves relatively few macroscopic variables of the system, which are suggested by common sense and can be usually measured directly. A microscopic description of a gas, for example, would involve specifying the co-ordinates and velocities of the huge number of molecules constituting the gas. The description in kinetic theory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve molecular distribution of velocities. Thermodynamic description of a gas, on the other (a) hand, avoids the molecular description altogether. Instead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is specified by macroscopic variables such as pressure, volume, temperature, mass and composition that  are felt by our sense perceptions and are measurable*. The distinction between mechanics and thermodynamics is worth bearing in mind.  In mechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles (b) or bodies under the action of forces and torques.

In energy, in particular), not its temperature.  When this case, thermal equilibrium is attained the bullet pierces a wood and stops, the kinetic in due course. energy of the bullet gets converted into heat, In general, whether or not a system is in a state changing the temperature of the bullet and the of equilibrium depends on the surroundings and surrounding layers of wood.  Temperature is the nature of the wall that separates the system related to the energy of the internal (disordered) from the surroundings.  Consider two gases A and motion of the bullet, not to the motion of the bullet B occupying two different containers. We know as a whole. experimentally that pressure and volume of a given mass of gas can be chosen to be its two 11.2  THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM independent variables.

Suppose first that the two systems The term ‘equilibrium’ in thermodynamics appears are put in proximity but are separated by an * Thermodynamics may also involve other variables that are not so obvious to our senses  e.g. entropy, enthalpy, etc., and they are all macroscopic variables. However, a thermodynamic state is specified by five state variables viz., pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy and entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorderness in the system. Enthalpy is a measure of total heat content of the system. 2024-25 228 PHYSICS adiabatic wall – an insulating wall (can be law in 1931 long after the first and second Laws movable) that does not allow flow of energy (heat) of thermodynamics were stated and so numbered. from one to another. The systems are insulated The Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two from the rest of the surroundings also by similar systems A and B, are in thermal equilibrium, adiabatic walls. The situation is shown there must be a physical quantity that has the schematically in Fig. 11.1 (a). In this case, it is same value for both. This thermodynamic found that any possible pair of values (P , V ) will A A variable whose value is equal for two systems in be in equilibrium with any possible pair of values thermal equilibrium is called temperature (T ). (P , V ).  Next, suppose that the adiabatic wall is B B Thus, if A and B are separately in equilibrium replaced by a diathermic wall – a conducting wall with C, TA = TC  and TB = TC.  This implies that that allows energy flow (heat) from one to another. TA = TB i.e. the systems A and B are also in It is then found that the macroscopic variables of thermal equilibrium. the systems A and B change spontaneously until We have arrived at the concept of temperature both the systems attain equilibrium states. After formally via the Zeroth Law.  The next question that there is no change in their states. The is : how to assign numerical values to situation is shown in Fig. 11.1(b).  The pressure temperatures of different bodies ?  In other words, and volume variables of the two gases change to how do we construct a scale of temperature ? (P ′, V ′) and (P ′, V ′) such that the new states B B A A Thermometry deals with this basic question to of A and B are in equilibrium with each other*. which we turn in the next section. There is no more energy flow from one to another. We then say that the system A is in thermal equilibrium with the system B. What characterises the situation of thermal equilibrium between two systems ? You can guess the answer from your experience. In thermal equilibrium, the temperatures of the two systems are equal. We shall see how does one arrive at the concept of temperature in thermodynamics? The Zeroth law of thermodynamics provides the clue. 11.3  ZEROTH LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS (a) Imagine two systems A and B, separated by an adiabatic wall, while each is in contact with a third system C, via a conducting wall [Fig. 11.2(a)]. The states of the systems (i.e., their macroscopic variables) will change until both A and B come to thermal equilibrium with C. After this is achieved, suppose that the adiabatic wall between A and B is replaced by a conducting wall and C is insulated from A and B by an adiabatic wall [Fig.11.2(b)]. It is found that the states of A and B change no (b) further i.e. they are found to be in thermal Fig. 11.2 (a) Systems A and B are separated by an equilibrium with each other. This observation adiabatic wall, while each is in contact forms the basis of the Zeroth Law of with a third system C via a conducting Thermodynamics, which states that ‘two wall. (b) The adiabatic wall between  A systems in thermal equilibrium with a third and B is replaced by a conducting wall, system separately are in thermal equilibrium while C is insulated from A and B by an with each other’.  R.H. Fowler formulated this adiabatic wall. * Both the variables need not change. It depends on the constraints. For instance, if the gases are in containers of fixed volume, only the pressures of the gases would change to achieve thermal equilibrium. 2024-25 THERMODYNAMICS 229 11.4  HEAT, INTERNAL ENERGY AND WORK associated with various random motions of its The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to molecules.  We will see in the next chapter that the concept of temperature that agrees with our in a gas this motion is not only translational commonsense notion.  Temperature is a marker (i.e. motion from one point to another in the of the ‘hotness’ of a body. It determines the volume of the container); it also includes direction of flow of heat when two bodies are rotational and vibrational motion of the placed in thermal contact.  Heat flows from the molecules (Fig. 11.3). body at a higher temperature to the one at lower temperature. The flow stops when the temperatures equalise; the two bodies are then in thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail how to construct temperature scales to assign temperatures to different bodies. We now describe the concepts of heat and other relevant quantities like internal energy and work. Fig. 11.3 (a) Internal energy U of a gas is the sum The concept of internal energy of a system is of the kinetic and potential energies of  its molecules when the box is at rest. Kinetic not difficult to understand.  We know that every energy due to various types of motion bulk system consists of a large number of (translational, rotational, vibrational) is to molecules.  Internal energy is simply the sum of be included in U.  (b) If the same box is the kinetic energies and potential energies of moving as a whole with some velocity, these molecules. We remarked earlier that in the kinetic energy of the box is not to be thermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the included in U. system, as a whole, is not relevant.  Internal energy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and potential energies in the frame of reference relative to which the centre of mass of the system is at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered) energy associated with the random motion of molecules of the system. We denote the internal energy of a system by U. Though we have invoked the molecular picture to understand the meaning of internal energy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned, U is simply a macroscopic variable of the system. The important thing about internal energy is that it depends only on the state of the system, not on how that state was achieved.  Internal energy U of a system is an example of a thermodynamic ‘state variable’ – its value depends only on the given state of the system, not on history i.e. not on the ‘path’ taken to arrive at that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given mass of gas depends on its state described by Fig. 11.4 Heat and work are two distinct modes of specific values of pressure, volume and energy transfer to a system that results  in temperature. It does not depend on how this change in its internal energy. (a) Heat is state of the gas came about. Pressure, volume, energy transfer due to temperature difference between the system and the temperature, and internal energy are surroundings.  (b) Work is energy transfer thermodynamic state variables of the system brought about by means (e.g. moving the (gas) (see section 11.7). If we neglect the small piston by raising or lowering some weight intermolecular forces in a gas, the internal connected to it) that do not involve such a energy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies temperature difference. 2024-25 230 PHYSICS What are the ways of changing internal 11.5  FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS energy of a system ? Consider again, for We have seen that the internal energy U of a simplicity, the system to be a certain mass of system can change through two modes of energy gas contained in a cylinder with a movable transfer : heat and work.  Let piston as shown in Fig. 11.4.  Experience shows there are two ways of changing the state of the ∆Q = Heat supplied to the system by the gas (and hence its internal energy).  One way is surroundings to put the cylinder in contact with a body at a ∆W = Work done by the system on the higher temperature than that of the gas. The surroundings temperature difference will cause a flow of ∆U = Change in internal energy of the system energy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas, The general principle of conservation of thus increasing the internal energy of the gas. energy then implies that The other way is to push the piston down i.e. to ∆Q =  ∆U + ∆W (11.1) do work on the system, which again results in increasing the internal energy of the gas.  Of i.e. the energy (∆Q) supplied to the system goes course, both these things could happen in the in partly to increase the internal energy of the reverse direction. With surroundings at a lower system (∆U) and the rest in work on the temperature, heat would flow from the gas to environment (∆W). Equation (11.1) is known as the surroundings.  Likewise, the gas could push the First Law of Thermodynamics.  It is simply the general law of conservation of energy applied the piston up and do work on the surroundings. to any system in which the energy transfer from In short, heat and work are two different modes or to the surroundings is taken into account. of altering the state of a thermodynamic system Let us put Eq. (11.1) in the alternative form and changing its internal energy. The notion of heat should be carefully ∆Q  – ∆W  = ∆U (11.2) distinguished from the notion of internal energy. Heat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in Now, the system may go from an initial state transit.  This is not just a play of words.  The to the final state in a number of ways. For distinction is of basic significance. The state of example, to change the state of a gas from a thermodynamic system is characterised by its (P , V ) to (P , V ), we can first change the 1 1 2 2 internal energy, not heat. A statement like ‘a volume of the gas from V  to V , keeping its 1 2 gas in a given state has a certain amount of pressure constant i.e. we can first go the state heat’ is as meaningless as the statement that (P , V ) and then change the pressure of the 1 2 gas from P  to P , keeping volume constant, to ‘a gas in a given state has a certain amount 1 2 take the gas to (P , V ).  Alternatively, we can of work’.  In contrast, ‘a gas in a given state 2 2 first keep the volume constant and then keep has a certain amount of internal energy’ is a the pressure constant. Since U is a state perfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the variable, ∆U depends only on the initial and statements ‘a certain amount of heat is final states and not on the path taken by the supplied to the system’ or ‘a certain amount gas to go from one to the other. However, ∆Q of work was done by the system’ are perfectly and ∆W will, in general, depend on the path meaningful. taken to go from the initial to final states. From To summarise, heat and work in the First Law of Thermodynamics, Eq. (11.2), thermodynamics are not state variables. They it is clear that the combination ∆Q – ∆W, is are modes of energy transfer to a system however, path independent. This shows that resulting in change in its internal energy, if a system is taken through a process in which which, as already mentioned, is a state variable. ∆U = 0 (for example, isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, see section 11.8), In ordinary language, we often confuse heat with internal energy.  The distinction between ∆Q  = ∆W them is sometimes ignored in elementary physics books. For proper understanding of i.e., heat supplied to the system is used up thermodynamics, however, the distinction is entirely by the system in doing work on the crucial. environment. 2024-25 THERMODYNAMICS 231 If the system is a gas in a cylinder with a If the amount of substance is specified in movable piston, the gas in moving the piston does terms of moles µ (instead of mass m in kg ), we work.

Like s, C is independent of the Thus, for this case, Eq. (11.1) gives amount of substance. C depends on the nature ∆Q  = ∆U + P ∆V (11.3) of the substance, its temperature and the conditions under which heat is supplied. The As an application of Eq. (11.3), consider the unit of C is J mo1–1 K–1. As we shall see later (in change in internal energy for 1 g of water when connection with specific heat capacity of gases), we go from its liquid to vapour phase. The additional conditions may be needed to define measured latent heat of water is 2256 J/g. i.e., C or s. The idea in defining C is that simple for 1 g of water ∆Q = 2256 J. At atmospheric predictions can be made in regard to molar pressure, 1 g of water has a volume 1 cm3 in specific heat capacities. liquid phase and 1671 cm3 in vapour phase.

We can use the same law of ∆U = 2256 – 169.2  =  2086.8 J equipartition of energy that we use there to predict molar specific heat capacities of solids We see that most of the heat goes to increase (See Section 12.5 and 12.6).

To prove the relation, we begin required to raise the temperature of 1g of water with Eq. (11.3) for 1 mole of the gas : by 1°C. With more precise measurements, it was found that the specific heat of water varies                 ∆Q  = ∆U + P ∆V slightly with temperature.

It is a good practice to check the consistency of thermodynamic equations using this classification of variables. For example, in the equation ∆Q = ∆U + P ∆V quantities on both sides are extensive*. (The product of an intensive variable like P and an extensive quantity ∆V is extensive.) 11.8  THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES 11.8.1  Quasi-static process Consider a gas in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings.

We now consider these processes in some detail : 11.8.2 Isothermal process For an isothermal process (T fixed), the ideal gas equation gives PV  =  constant i.e., pressure of a given mass of gas varies inversely as its volume. This is nothing but Boyle’s Law.

The table could cool cited. The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter spontaneously, converting some of its internal than its other parts. When the vessel is removed, energy into an equal amount of mechanical heat is transferred from the base to the other energy of the book, which would then hop to a parts, bringing the vessel to a uniform height with potential energy equal to the temperature (which in due course cools to the mechanical energy it acquired.  But this never temperature of the surroundings). The process happens.

A little reflection shows that we can only adopt Why is reversibility such a basic concept in reversible adiabatic processes for these thermodynamics ?  As we have seen, one of the purposes, which involve no heat flow from any concerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency reservoir. If we employ any other process that is with which heat can be converted into work. not adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take The Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out the system from one temperature to another, we the possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100% shall need a series of reservoirs in the efficiency.
