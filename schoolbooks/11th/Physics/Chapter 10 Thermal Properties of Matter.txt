CHAPTER TEN THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 10.1  INTRODUCTION We all have common sense notions of heat and temperature. Temperature is a measure of ‘hotness’ of a body. A kettle 10.1 Introduction with boiling water is hotter than a box containing ice. In 10.2 Temperature and heat physics, we need to define the notion of heat, temperature, 10.3 Measurement of etc., more carefully. In this chapter, you will learn what heat temperature is and how it is measured, and study the various proceses by 10.4 Ideal-gas equation and which heat flows from one body to another. Along the way, absolute temperature you will find out why blacksmiths heat the iron ring before 10.5 Thermal expansion fitting on the rim of a wooden wheel of a horse cart and why 10.6 Specific heat capacity the wind at the beach often reverses direction after the sun 10.7 Calorimetry goes down.

Summary 10.2  TEMPERATURE AND HEAT Points to ponder Exercises We can begin studying thermal properties of matter with Additional Exercises definitions of temperature and heat. Temperature is a relative measure, or indication of hotness or coldness. A hot utensil is said to have a high temperature, and ice cube to have a low temperature. An object that has a higher temperature than another object is said to be hotter. Note that hot and cold are relative terms, like tall and short. We can perceive temperature by touch. However, this temperature sense is somewhat unreliable and its range is too limited to be useful for scientific purposes. We know from experience that a glass of ice-cold water left on a table on a hot summer day eventually warms up whereas a cup of hot tea on the same table cools down. It means that when the temperature of body, ice-cold water or hot tea in this case, and its surrounding medium are different, heat transfer takes place between the system and the surrounding medium, until the body and the surrounding medium are at the same temperature. We also know that in the case of glass tumbler of ice-cold water, heat flows from the environment to 2024-25 THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 203 the glass tumbler, whereas in the case of hot tea, it flows from the cup of hot tea to the environment. So, we can say that heat is the form of energy transferred between two (or more) systems or a system and its surroundings by virtue of temperature difference. The SI unit of heat energy transferred is expressed in joule (J) while SI unit of temperature is Kelvin (K), and degree Celsius (oC) is a commonly used unit of temperature. When an object is heated, many changes may take place. Its temperature may rise, it may expand or change state. We will study the effect of heat on different bodies in later sections.

Many physical properties of  A relationship for converting between the two materials change sufficiently with temperature. scales may be obtained from a graph of Some such properties are used as the basis for Fahrenheit temperature (tF) versus celsius constructing thermometers. The commonly used temperature (tC) in a straight line (Fig. 10.1), property is variation of the volume of a liquid whose equation is with temperature. For example, in common t t F – 32 = C liquid–in–glass thermometers,  mercury, alcohol (10.1) 180 100 etc., are used whose volume varies linearly with temperature over a wide range. 10.4 IDEAL-GAS EQUATION AND Thermometers are calibrated so that a ABSOLUTE TEMPERATURE numerical value may be assigned to a given temperature in an appropriate scale. For the Liquid-in-glass thermometers show different definition of any standard scale, two fixed readings for temperatures other than the fixed reference points are needed. Since all points because of differing expansion properties. substances change dimensions with A thermometer that uses a gas, however, gives temperature, an absolute reference for the same readings regardless of which gas is expansion is not available. However, the used. Experiments show that all gases at low necessary fixed points may be correlated to the densities exhibit same expansion behaviour. The physical phenomena that always occur at the variables that describe the behaviour of a given same temperature. The ice point and the steam quantity (mass) of gas are pressure, volume, and point of water are two convenient fixed points temperature (P, V, and T )(where T = t + 273.15; and are known as the freezing and boiling t is the temperature in °C). When temperature points, respectively. These two points are the is held constant, the pressure and volume of a temperatures at which pure water freezes and quantity of gas are related as  PV = constant. boils under standard pressure. The two familiar This relationship is known as Boyle’s law, after temperature scales are the Fahrenheit Robert Boyle (1627–1691), the English Chemist temperature scale and the Celsius temperature who discovered it.

This relationship is known as Charles’ law, On the Fahrenheit scale, there are 180 equal after  French scientist Jacques Charles (1747– intervals between two reference points, and on 1823). Low-density gases obey these the Celsius scale, there are 100. laws, which may be combined into a single 2024-25 204 PHYSICS Fig. 10.3 A plot of pressure versus temperature and Fig. 10.2 Pressure versus temperature of a low extrapolation of lines for low density gases density gas kept at constant volume. indicates the same absolute zero temperature. relationship. Notice that since PV = constant named after the British scientist Lord Kelvin. On and V/T = constant for a given quantity of gas, this scale, – 273.15 °C is taken as the zero point, then PV/T should also be a constant. This that is 0 K (Fig. 10.4). relationship is known as ideal gas law. It can be written in a more general form that applies not just to a given quantity of a single gas but to any quantity of any low-density gas and is known as ideal-gas equation: or PV = µRT (10.2) where, µ is the number of moles in the sample of gas and R is called universal gas constant: R = 8.31 J mol–1 K–1 In Eq. 10.2, we have learnt that the pressure and volume are directly proportional to temperature : PV ∝ T. This relationship allows a gas to be used to measure temperature in a constant volume gas thermometer. Holding the volume of a gas constant, it gives P ∝T. Thus, with a constant-volume gas thermometer, Fig. 10.4 Comparision of the Kelvin, Celsius and temperature is read in terms of pressure. A plot Fahrenheit temperature scales. The size of unit in Kelvin and Celsius of pressure versus temperature gives a straight temperature scales is the same.  So, temperature line in this case, as shown in Fig. 10.2. on these scales are related by However, measurements on real gases deviate from the values predicted by the ideal gas law T = tC + 273.15 (10.3) at low temperature. But the relationship is linear over a large temperature range, and it looks as 10.5  THERMAL EXPANSION though the pressure might reach zero with You may have observed that sometimes sealed decreasing temperature if the gas continued to bottles with metallic lids are so tightly screwed be a gas.

This would allow the metallic lid extrapolating the straight line to the axis, as in to expand, thereby loosening it to unscrew Fig. 10.3.  This temperature is found to be easily.

Iron 1.2 It is our common experience that most Copper 1.7 substances expand on heating and contract on Silver 1.9 cooling. A change in the temperature of a body Gold 1.4 causes change in its dimensions. The increase Glass (pyrex) 0.32 in the dimensions of a body due to the increase Lead 0.29 in its temperature is called thermal expansion. The expansion in length is called linear Similarly, we consider the fractional change expansion. The expansion in area is called area expansion. The expansion in volume is called ∆V in volume, , of a substance for temperature volume expansion (Fig. 10.5). V change ∆T and define the coefficient of volume expansion (or volume expansivity),   as (10.5) Here αV is also a characteristic of the substance but is not strictly a constant. It ∆ depends in general on temperature (Fig 10.6). It l ∆A ∆V = a = 2 ∆T l∆T a l = 3a l∆T is seen that αV becomes constant only at a high l A V temperature.

If the substance is in the form of a long rod, then for small change in temperature, ∆T, the fractional change in length, ∆l/l, is directly proportional to ∆T.

In Table Fig. 10.6 Coefficient of volume expansion of copper 10.1, typical average values of the coefficient of as a function of temperature. linear expansion for some material in the temperature range 0 °C to 100 °C are given. From Table 10.2 gives the values of coefficient of this Table, compare the value of αl for glass and volume expansion of some common substances copper. We find that copper expands about five in the temperature range 0–100 °C. You can see times more than glass for the same rise in that thermal expansion of these substances temperature. Normally, metals expand more and (solids and liquids) is rather small, with material, have relatively high values of αl. 2024-25 206 PHYSICS like pyrex glass and invar (a special iron-nickel lakes and ponds, freeze at the top first.

From cools toward 4 °C, water near the surface loses this Table we find that the value of αv for energy to the atmosphere, becomes denser, and alcohol (ethanol) is more than mercury and sinks; the warmer, less dense water near the expands more than mercury for the same rise bottom rises. However, once the colder water on in temperature. top reaches temperature below 4 °C, it becomes less dense and remains at the surface, where it Table 10.2 Values of coefficient of volume freezes.

For liquids, the Iron 3.55 × 10–5 coefficient of volume expansion is relatively Paraffin 58.8 × 10–5 independent of the temperature. However, for Glass (ordinary) 2.5 × 10–5 gases it is dependent on temperature. For an Glass (pyrex) 1 × 10–5 ideal gas, the coefficient of volume expansion at Hard rubber 2.4 × 10–4 constant pressure can be found from the ideal Invar 2 × 10–6 gas equation: Mercury 18.2 × 10–5 PV = µRT Water 20.7 × 10–5 At constant pressure Alcohol (ethanol) 110 × 10–5 P∆V = µR ∆T ∆V = ∆T Water exhibits an anomalous behaviour; it V T contracts on heating between 0 °C and 4 °C.

Below At 0 °C, αv = 3.7 × 10–3 K–1, which is much 4 °C, the volume increases, and therefore, the larger than that for solids and liquids. density decreases [Fig. 10.7(b)]. Equation (10.6) shows the temperature This means that water has the maximum dependence of αv; it decreases with increasing density at 4 °C. This property has an important temperature. For a gas at room temperature and environmental effect: bodies of water, such as constant pressure, αv is about 3300 × 10–6 K–1, as Temperature (°C) Temperature (°C) (a) (b) Fig. 10.7 Thermal expansion of water. 2024-25 THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER 207 much as order(s) of magnitude larger than the Answer coefficient of volume expansion of typical liquids. ∆A  = (∆a) (∆b) 3 There is a simple relation between the ∆A  = a (∆b) coefficient of volume expansion (α ) and l v coefficient of linear expansion (α ). Imagine a l ∆b cube of length, l, that expands equally in all directions, when its temperature increases by b ∆T. We have ∆a a ∆l = α  l ∆T l so, ∆V = (l+∆l)3 – l3 ≃  3l2 ∆l (10.7) In Equation (10.7), terms in (∆l)2 and (∆l)3 have been neglected since ∆l is small compared to l.

The heat supplied is now being utilised to change water from liquid state to vapour or  gaseous state. The change of state from liquid to vapour (or gas) is called vaporisation. It is observed that the temperature remains constant until the entire amount of the liquid is converted into vapour. That is, both the liquid and vapour states of the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium, during the change of state from liquid to vapour. The temperature at which the liquid and the vapour states of the substance coexist is called Fig. 10.10 its boiling point. Let us do the following activity After the whole of ice gets converted into water to understand the process of boiling of water. and as we continue further heating, we shall see that temperature begins to rise (Fig.10.9). The Take a round-bottom flask, more than half temperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly filled with water. Keep it over a burner and fix a Triple Point The temperature of a substance remains constant during its change of state (phase change). A graph between the temperature T and the Pressure P of the substance is called a phase diagram or P – T diagram. The following figure shows the phase diagram of water and CO . 2 Such a phase diagram divides the P – T plane into a solid-region, the vapour-region and the liquid-region. The regions are separated by the curves such as sublimation curve (BO), fusion curve (AO) and vaporisation curve (CO). The points on sublimation curve represent states in which solid and vapour phases coexist. The point on the sublimation curve BO represent states in which the solid and vapour phases co-exist. Points on the fusion curve AO represent states in which solid and liquid phase coexist. Points on the vapourisation curve CO represent states in which the liquid and vapour phases coexist. The temperature and pressure at which the fusion curve, the vaporisation curve and the sublimation curve meet and all the three phases of  a substance coexist is called the triple point of the substance. For example the triple point of water is represented by the temperature 273.16 K and pressure 6.11×10–3 Pa.

On the other hand, boiling it comes out of the flask, it condenses as tiny point is increased inside a pressure cooker by droplets of water, giving a foggy appearance. increasing the pressure. Hence cooking is faster. The boiling point of a substance at standard atmospheric pressure is called its normal boiling point. However, all substances do not pass through the three states: solid-liquid-gas. There are certain substances which normally pass from the solid to the vapour state directly and vice versa. The change from solid state to vapour state without passing through the liquid state is called sublimation, and the substance is said to sublime. Dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, so also iodine. During the sublimation process both the solid and vapour states of a substance coexist in thermal equilibrium. 10.8.1  Latent Heat In Section 10.8, we have learnt that certain amount of heat energy is transferred between a substance and its surroundings when it undergoes a change of state. The amount of heat per unit mass transferred during change of state of the substance is called latent heat of the substance for the process.

More heat temperature but causes the ice to melt, or would be required to raise the temperature changes its state. Once the entire ice melts, (depending on the increase in pressure) before adding more heat will cause the temperature of boiling begins again. Thus boiling point increases the water to rise. A similar situation with increase in pressure. occurs during liquid gas change of state at the Let us now remove the burner. Allow water to boiling point. Adding more heat to boiling water cool to about 80 °C. Remove the thermometer and causes vaporisation, without increase in steam outlet.
