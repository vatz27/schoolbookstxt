CHAPTER ONE UNITS AND MEASUREMENT 1.1  INTRODUCTION Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally accepted reference standard called unit. The result of a 1.1 Introduction measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a 1.2 The international system of number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit. units Although the number of physical quantities appears to be 1.3 Significant figures very large, we need only a limited number of units for expressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter1.4 Dimensions of physical related with one another. The units for the fundamental or quantities base quantities are called fundamental or base units. The 1.5 Dimensional formulae and units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as dimensional equations combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the 1.6 Dimensional analysis and its derived quantities are called derived units. A complete set applications of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. Summary Exercises 1.2  THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS In earlier time scientists of different countries were using different systems of units for measurement. Three such systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS system were in use extensively till recently. The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows : • In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively. • In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively. • In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively. The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale d’ Unites (French for International System of Units), abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau International des Poids et measures (The International Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in November 2018. The scheme is now for 2024-25 2 PHYSICS international usage in scientific, technical, industrial and commercial work.  Because SI units used decimal system, conversions within the system are quite simple and convenient. We shall follow the SI units in this book. In SI, there are seven base units as given in (a) Table 1.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two more units that are defined for (a) plane angle dθ as the ratio of length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid angle dΩ as the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the spherical surface, described about the apex O as the centre, to the square of its radius r, as shown in Fig. 1.1(a) and (b) respectively.  The unit for plane angle (b) is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both these are Fig. 1.1 Description of (a) plane angle dθ and dimensionless quantities. (b) solid angle dΩ .

It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458 when expressed in the unit m s–1, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency ∆νcs. Mass kilogram kg The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10–34 when expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s–1, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of c and ∆νcs. Time second s The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency ∆νcs, the unperturbed groundstate hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1. Electric ampere A The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be 1.602176634×10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms of ∆νcs. Thermo kelvin K The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. dynamic It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant Temperature k to be 1.380649×10–23 when expressed in the unit J K–1, which is equal to kg m2 s–2 k–1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆νcs. Amount of mole mol The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole substance contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N , when expressed in the A unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance, symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles. Luminous candela cd The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in given direction. intensity It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 Hz, K , to be 683 when expressed cd in the unit lm W–1, which is equal to cd sr W–1, or cd sr kg–1m–2s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆νcs. * The values mentioned here need not be remembered or asked in a test. They are given here only to  indicate the extent of accuracy to which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring techniques get improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The definitions of base units are revised to keep up with this progress. 2024-25 UNITS AND MEASUREMENT 3 Table 1.2   Some units retained for general use (Though outside SI) Note that when mole is used, the elementary the first uncertain digit are known as entities  must  be specified.

Then the number can be • All the non-zero digits are significant. expressed approximately as 10b in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of • All the zeros between two non-zero digits magnitude of the physical quantity.

It is evident that the zeroes here (4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting are meant to convey the precision of measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use measurement and are, therefore, significant.

In general, the final result should not have more significant 1.3.2   Rounding off the Uncertain Digits figures than the original data from which it was The result of computation with approximate obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured numbers, which contain more than one to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and uncertain digit, should be rounded off.  The rules its volume is measured to be 2.51 cm3, then its for rounding off numbers to the appropriate density, by mere arithmetic division, is significant figures are obvious in most cases.

The rule by convention is that the precision when the measurements on which the preceding digit is raised by 1 if the value is based, have much less precision. The insignificant digit to be dropped (the following rules for arithmetic operations with underlined digit in this case)  is more than significant figures ensure that the final result 5, and is left  unchanged if the latter is less of a calculation is shown with the precision that than 5.

For example, the dimensional formula of the volume The nature of a physical quantity is described is [M° L3 T°],  and  that of speed or velocity is by its dimensions.

Similarly, [M° L T–2] is the dimensional represented by derived units can be expressed formula of acceleration and [M L–3 T°] that of in terms of some combination of seven mass density. fundamental or base quantities. We shall call An equation obtained by equating a physical these base quantities as the seven dimensions quantity with its dimensional formula is called of the physical world, which are denoted with the dimensional equation of the physical square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the quantity.  Thus, the dimensional equations are dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current the equations, which represent the dimensions [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous of a physical quantity in terms of the base intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. quantities. For example, the dimensional The dimensions of a physical quantity are the equations of volume [V ],  speed [v], force [F ] and powers (or exponents) to which the base mass density [ρ] may be expressed as quantities are raised to represent that [V] = [M0 L3 T0] quantity. Note that using the square brackets [v] = [M0 L T–1] [  ] round a quantity means that we are dealing [F] = [M L T–2] with ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity. [ρ] = [M L–3 T0] In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] The dimensional equation can be obtained and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by from the equation representing the relations an object is expressed as the product of length, between the physical quantities.

Thus, a dimensionally correct appearing in the original mathematical relation, equation need not be actually an exact when all the individual dimensions are (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong simplified, the remaining dimension must be (incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be that of length.

Certain physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity). 2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. 3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units. 4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world. 5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by means of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc). 6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.). 7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision of the numbers. 8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements. 9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired units are obtained. 10. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained. Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic operations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed. 11. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong. EXERCISES Note : In stating numerical answers, take care of significant figures. 1.1 Fill in the blanks (a) The volume of a cube of side 1 cm is equal to .....m3 (b) The surface area of a solid cylinder of radius 2.0 cm and height 10.0 cm is equal to ...(mm)2 (c)  A vehicle moving with a speed of 18 km h–1 covers....m in 1 s (d) The relative density of lead is 11.3.

Suppose we employ a system of units in which the unit of mass equals α kg, the unit of length equals β m, the unit of time is γ s.  Show that a calorie has a magnitude 4.2 α –1 β –2 γ 2 in terms of the new units. 1.4 Explain this statement clearly : “To call a dimensional quantity ‘large’ or ‘small’ is meaningless without specifying a standard for comparison”. In view of this, reframe the following statements wherever necessary : (a) atoms are very small objects (b) a jet plane moves with great speed (c) the mass of Jupiter is very large (d) the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules (e) a proton is much more massive than an electron (f) the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light. 1.5 A new unit of length is chosen such that the speed of light in vacuum is unity. What is the distance between the Sun and the Earth in terms of the new unit if light takes 8 min and 20 s to cover this distance ? 1.6 Which of the following is the most precise device for measuring length : (a) a vernier callipers with 20 divisions on the sliding scale (b) a screw gauge of pitch 1 mm and 100 divisions on the circular scale (c) an optical instrument that can measure length to within a wavelength of light ? 1.7 A student measures the thickness of a human hair by looking at it through a microscope of magnification 100. He makes 20 observations and finds that the average width of the hair in the field of view of the microscope is 3.5 mm. What is the estimate on the thickness of hair ? 1.8 Answer the following : (a)You are given a thread and a metre scale.  How will you estimate the diameter of the thread ? (b)A screw gauge has a pitch of 1.0 mm and 200 divisions on the circular scale. Do you think it is possible to increase the accuracy of the screw gauge arbitrarily by increasing the number of divisions on the circular scale ? (c) The mean diameter of a thin brass rod is to be measured by  vernier callipers.  Why is a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable estimate than a set of 5 measurements only ? 1.9 The photograph of a house occupies an area of 1.75 cm2 on a 35 mm slide.  The slide is projected on to a screen, and the area of the house on the screen is 1.55 m2.  What is the linear magnification of the projector-screen arrangement. 1.10 State the number of significant figures in the following : (a)  0.007 m2 (b)  2.64 × 1024 kg (c)  0.2370 g cm–3 (d)  6.320 J (e)  6.032 N m–2 (f)   0.0006032 m2 1.11 The length, breadth and thickness of a rectangular sheet of metal are 4.234 m, 1.005 m, and 2.01 cm respectively. Give the area and volume of the sheet to correct significant figures. 1.12 The mass of a box measured by a grocer’s balance is 2.30 kg. Two gold pieces of masses 20.15 g  and 20.17 g are added to the box.  What is (a) the total mass of the box, (b) the difference in the masses of the pieces to correct significant figures ? 1.13 A famous relation in physics relates ‘moving mass’ m to the ‘rest mass’ m  of a o particle in terms of its speed v and the speed of light, c.  (This relation first arose as a consequence of special relativity due to Albert Einstein). A boy recalls the relation almost correctly but forgets where to put the constant c.  He writes : m0 m = ( )1 2 1− 2 / . v Guess where to put the missing c. 2024-25 12 PHYSICS 1.14 The unit of length convenient on the atomic scale is known as an angstrom and is denoted by Å: 1 Å = 10–10 m. The size of a hydrogen atom is about 0.5 Å. What is the total  atomic volume in m3 of a mole of hydrogen atoms ? 1.15 One mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure occupies 22.4 L (molar volume). What is the ratio of molar volume to the atomic volume of a mole of hydrogen ?   (Take the size of  hydrogen molecule to be about 1 Å). Why is this ratio so large ? 1.16 Explain this common observation clearly : If you look out of the window of a fast moving train, the nearby trees, houses etc. seem to move rapidly in a direction opposite to the train’s motion, but the distant objects (hill tops, the Moon, the stars etc.) seem to be stationary. (In fact, since you  are aware that you are moving, these distant objects seem to move with you). 1.17 The Sun is a hot plasma (ionized matter) with its inner core at a temperature exceeding 107 K, and its outer surface at a temperature of about 6000 K. At these high temperatures, no substance remains in a solid or liquid phase. In what range do you expect the mass density of the Sun to be, in the range of densities of solids and liquids or gases ?  Check if your guess is correct from the following data : mass of the Sun = 2.0 ×1030 kg, radius of the Sun = 7.0 × 108 m. 2024-25
