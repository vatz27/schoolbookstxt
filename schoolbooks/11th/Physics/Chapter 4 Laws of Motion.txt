CHAPTER FOUR LAWS OF MOTION 4.1  INTRODUCTION In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the motion of a particle in space quantitatively. We saw that 4.1 Introduction uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas 4.2 Aristotle’s fallacy non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in 4.3 The law of inertia addition.  So far, we have not asked the question as to what 4.4 Newton’s first law of motion governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this 4.5 basic question. Newton’s second law of motion Let us first guess the answer based on our common 4.6 experience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. Newton’s third law of motion To throw a stone upwards, one has to  give it an upward 4.7 Conservation of momentum push.  A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a 4.8 Equilibrium of a particle strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a 4.9 Common forces in mechanics flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external 4.10 Circular motion agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. 4.11 Solving problems in Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop mechanics motion.  You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by Summary applying a force against the direction of its motion. Points to ponder In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, Exercises wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth.  A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces )  can exert  force on a body even from a distance. In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. So far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab) ?  Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion? 2024-25 50 PHYSICS 4.2  ARISTOTLE’S  FALLACY true law of nature for forces and motion, one has The question posed above appears to be simple. to imagine a world in which uniform motion is However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the possible with no frictional forces opposing. This correct answer to this question given by Galileo is what Galileo did. in the seventeenth century was the foundation 4.3  THE LAW OF INERTIA of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined birth of modern science. plane.  Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane The Greek thinker,  Aristotle (384 B.C– 322 accelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard. B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, (iii) Motion on a horizontal plane  is an intermesomething external is required to keep it moving. diate situation.  Galileo concluded that an object According to this view, for example, an arrow moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must shot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it the arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of an elaborate framework of ideas developed by should move with constant velocity (Fig. 4.1(a)). Aristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe. Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now known to be wrong and need not concern us. For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required  to keep a body in motion. (i) (ii) (iii) Aristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall Fig. 4.1(a) see.  However, it is a natural view that anyone Another experiment by Galileo leading to the would hold from common experience. Even a same conclusion involves a double inclined plane. small child playing with a simple (non-electric) A ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls down and climbs up the other. If the planes are toy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs smooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the to constantly drag the string attached to the toysame as the initial height (a little less but never car with some force to keep it going.  If it releases greater). In the ideal situation, when friction is the string, it comes to rest. This experience is absent, the final height of the ball is the same common to most terrestrial motion. External as its initial height. forces seem to be needed to keep bodies in If the slope of the second plane is decreased motion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually and the experiment repeated, the ball will still come to rest. reach the same height, but in doing so, it will What is the flaw in Aristotle’s argument? The travel a longer distance.  In the limiting case, when answer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a the external force of friction on the car by the floor horizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance. opposes its motion. To counter this force, the child In other words, its motion never ceases. This is, has to apply an external force on the car in the of course, an idealised situation (Fig. 4.1(b)). direction of motion.  When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force ( friction) by the floor.  The corollary is: if there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. The opposing forces such as friction (solids) and viscous forces (for fluids) are always present in the natural world.  This explains why forces by external agencies are necessary to overcome the frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform motion. Now we understand  where Aristotle Fig. 4.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo went wrong.  He coded this practical experience from observations of motion of a ball on a in the form of a basic argument.  To get at the double inclined plane. 2024-25 LAWS OF MOTION 51 In practice, the ball does come to a stop after accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane, Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all times. because of the opposing force of friction which Newton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the can never be totally eliminated.  However, if there foundation of mechanics in terms of three laws were no friction, the ball would continue  to move of  motion that go by his name.  Galileo’s law of with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane. inertia was his starting point which he formuGalileo thus, arrived at a new insight on lated as the first law of motion: motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who Every body continues to be in its state followed him.  The state of rest and the state of of rest or of uniform motion in a straight uniform linear motion (motion with constant line unless compelled by some external velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is force to act otherwise. Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of motion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force of wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter’s rod strikes the wheel; persistent tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body; transmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia.  Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance.  It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational and vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a definite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time.  It was known that the position of a particle in space can be indicated by distance measured along three axes.  Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept of ‘instantaneous motion’ (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly understood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results from the transmission of vibrations of water particles. no net force acting on the body.  It is incorrect to The state of rest or uniform linear motion both assume that a net force is needed to keep a body imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion  can, in uniform motion. To maintain a body in therefore, be simply expressed as: uniform motion, we need to apply an external If the net external force on a body is zero, its force to ecounter the frictional force, so that acceleration is zero.  Acceleration can be non the two forces sum up to zero net external zero only if there is a net external force on force. the body. To summarise, if the net external force is zero, a body at rest continues to remain at rest and a Two kinds of situations are encountered in the body in motion continues to move with a uniform application of this law in practice. In some velocity.  This property of the body is called examples, we know that the net external force inertia. Inertia means ‘resistance to  change’. on the object is zero. In that case we can A body does not change its state of rest or conclude that the acceleration of the object is uniform motion, unless an external force zero.  For example, a spaceship out in compels it to change that state. interstellar space, far from all other objects and with all its rockets turned off, has no net 4.4  NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION external force acting on it.  Its acceleration, Galileo’s simple, but revolutionary ideas according to the first law, must be zero.  If it is dethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new in motion, it must continue to move with a mechanics had to be developed. This task was uniform velocity. 2024-25 52 PHYSICS More often, however, we do not know all the The acceleration of the car cannot be accounted forces to begin with.  In that case, if we know for by any internal force.  This might sound that an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either surprising, but it is true.  The only conceivable at rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer external force along the road is the force of from the first law that the net external force on friction.  It is the frictional force that accelerates the object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere. the car as a whole.  (You will learn about friction For terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every in section 4.9).  When the car moves with object experiences gravitational force due to the constant velocity, there is no net external force. earth.  Also objects in motion generally experience The property of inertia contained in the First friction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an law is evident in many situations.  Suppose we object is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is are standing in a stationary  bus and the driver not because there are no forces acting on it, but starts the bus suddenly. We get thrown because the various external forces cancel out backward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch i.e. add up to zero net external force. with the floor. If there were no friction, we would Consider a book at rest on a horizontal surface remain where we were, while the floor of the bus Fig. (4.2(a)).  It is subject to two external forces : would simply slip forward under our feet and the the force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting back of the bus would hit us.  However, downward and the upward force on the book by fortunately, there is some friction between the the table, the normal force R . R is a self-adjusting feet and the floor.  If the start is not too sudden, force. This is an example of the kind of situation i.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional mentioned above. The forces are not quite known force would be enough to accelerate our feet fully but the state of motion is known. We observe along with the bus.  But our body is not strictly the book to be at rest.  Therefore, we conclude a rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some from the first law that the magnitude of R equals relative displacement between different parts. that of W. A statement often encountered is : What this means is that while our feet go with “Since W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book the bus, the rest of the body remains where it is is at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct due to inertia.  Relative to the bus, therefore, we statement is : “Since the book is observed to be at are thrown backward.  As soon as that happens, rest, the net external force on it must be zero, however, the muscular forces on the rest of the according to the first law. This implies that the body (by the feet) come into play to move the body normal force R  must be equal and opposite to the along with the bus. A similar thing happens weight W ”. when the bus suddenly stops.  Our feet stop due to the friction which does not allow relative motion between the feet and the floor of the bus. But the rest of the body continues to move forward due to inertia.  We are thrown forward. The restoring muscular forces again come into play and bring the body to rest. Example 4.1  An astronaut accidentally gets separated out of his small spaceship accelerating in inter stellar space at a Fig. 4.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car constant rate of 100 m s–2.  What is the moving with uniform velocity. The net force acceleration of the astronaut the instant after is zero in each case. he is outside the spaceship ?

The conclusion is clear: force It relates the net external force to the not only depends on the change in momentum, acceleration of the body. but also on how fast the change is brought Momentum about.  The same change in momentum Momentum of a body is defined to be the product brought about in a shorter time needs a of its mass m and velocity v, and is denoted greater applied force. In short, the greater the by p: rate of change of momentum, the greater is p = m v         (4.1) the force. Momentum is clearly a vector quantity.  The following common experiences indicate the importance of this quantity for considering the effect of force on motion. • Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small car) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded truck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all know that a much greater force is needed to push the truck than the car to bring them to the same speed in same time.  Similarly, a greater opposing force is needed to stop a heavy body than a light body in the same time, if they are moving with the same speed. • If two stones, one light and the other heavy, are dropped from the top of a building, a Fig. 4.3 Force not only depends on the change in person on the ground will find it easier to catch momentum but also on how fast the change the light stone than the heavy stone.

In the examples so far, momentum and change           ∝ ∆p ∆p F  or  F =  k ∆t ∆t in momentum both have the same direction. But this is not always the case.  Suppose a where k  is a constant of proportionality.

A force is needed dp to cause this change in momentum vector. respect to t, denoted by .  Thus dt This force is provided by our hand through the string.  Experience suggests that our hand dp F = k (4.2) needs to exert a greater force if the stone is dt rotated at greater speed or in a circle of For a body of fixed mass m, smaller radius, or both. This corresponds to greater acceleration or equivalently a greater dp d ( dv = m v) = m = m a      (4.3) rate of change in momentum vector. This dt dt dt suggests that the greater the rate of change i.e the Second Law can also be written as in momentum vector the greater is the force F  =   k m a         (4.4) applied. which shows that force is proportional to the product of mass m and acceleration a. The unit of force has not been defined so far. In fact, we use Eq. (4.4) to define the unit of force. We, therefore, have the liberty to choose any constant value for k.  For simplicity, we choose k = 1. The second law then is dp F =    =  m a (4.5) dt In SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration of 1 m s-2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2. Let us note at this stage some important points Fig. 4.4 Force is necessary  for changing the direction of momentum, even if its magnitude is about the second law : constant. We can feel this while rotating a 1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = 0. The second stone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed law is obviously  consistent with the first law. by means of a string. 2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is These qualitative observations lead to the equivalent to three equations, one for each second law of motion expressed by Newton as component of the vectors : follows : dp The rate of change of momentum of a body is F = x x = ma x dt directly proportional to the applied force and dp takes place in the direction in which the force y Fy = = ma y acts. dt dp Thus, if under the action of a force F for time F z z = =m a z                                   (4.6) interval ∆t, the velocity of a body of mass m dt changes from v to v + ∆v i.e. its initial momentum This means that if a force is not parallel to p = m v changes by ∆p = m∆v .

Force is the force. In the history of science, impulsive forces were mutual interaction between two bodies.  Forces put in a conceptually different category from always occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces ordinary forces.  Newtonian mechanics has no such between two bodies are always equal and distinction.  Impulsive force is like any other force – opposite.

In some examples, the answer seems bodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair clear.  If you press a coiled spring, the spring is of bodies A and B.  According to the third law, compressed by the force of your hand.  The F   =  – F (4.8) compressed spring in turn exerts a force on your AB BA hand and you can feel it.

Does the stone exert one body (A or B), only one of the two forces is a force on the earth ?  The answer is not obvious relevant.  It is an error to add up the two forces since we hardly see the effect of the stone on the and claim that the net force is zero. earth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes, However, if you are considering the system the stone does exert an equal and opposite force of two bodies as a whole, F  and F  are AB BA on the earth.

This answer is wrong.  The force on the wall is normal to the wall in both cases. The second and third laws of motion lead to How to find the force on the wall? The trick is an important consequence: the law of to consider the force (or impulse) on  the ball conservation of momentum.  Take a familiar due to  the wall using the second law, and then example.

According to the second law, F ∆t is the change the change in momentum of the ball in each in momentum of the bullet and – F ∆t is the case : change in momentum of the gun. Since initially, both are at rest, the change in momentum equals Case (a) the final momentum for each.

Contact 2 Consider the equilibrium of the point P under forces arise also when solids are in contact with the action of three forces - the tensions T  and fluids.  For example, for a solid immersed in a 1 T , and the horizontal force 50 N.  The horizontal fluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to 2 and vertical components of the resultant force the weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous must vanish separately : force, air resistance, etc are also examples of contact forces (Fig. 4.9).

When a spring which gives that is compressed or extended by an external force, a restoring force is generated. This force is usually proportional to the compression or Note the answer does not depend on the length elongation (for small displacements). The spring of the rope  (assumed massless) nor on the point force F is written as F = – k x where x is the at which the horizontal force is applied. ⊳ displacement and k is the force constant. The negative sign denotes that the force is opposite 4.9  COMMON FORCES IN MECHANICS to the displacement from the unstretched state. In mechanics, we encounter several kinds of For an inextensible string, the force constant is forces. The gravitational force is, of course, very high. The restoring force in a string is called pervasive.  Every object on the earth experiences tension. It is customary to use a constant tension the force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also T throughout the string. This assumption is true governs the motion of celestial bodies.

Of these, the weak and strong All the other forces common in mechanics are forces appear in domains that do not concern contact forces.* As the name suggests, a contact us here.

When there is no applied force, magnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic there is no static friction.

As the applied (nuclei and electrons) and the various contact force F increases, f  also increases, remaining s forces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular equal and opposite to the applied force (up to a collisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be certain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it traced to the electrical forces between the charged is called static friction.  Static friction opposes constituents of different bodies. The detailed impending motion. The term impending motion means motion that would take place (but does microscopic origin of these forces is, however, not actually take place) under the applied force, complex and not useful for handling problems in if friction were absent. mechanics at the macroscopic scale.
