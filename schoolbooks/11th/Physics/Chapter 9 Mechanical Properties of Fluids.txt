CHAPTER NINE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 9.1 INTRODUCTION In this chapter, we shall study  some common physical properties of liquids and gases. Liquids and gases can  flow 9.1 Introduction and are therefore, called  fluids.  It is this property that 9.2 Pressure distinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way. 9.3 Streamline flow Fluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of 9.4 Bernoulli’s principle air and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water.  Water 9.5 Viscosity is not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian 9.6 body constitute mostly of water. All the  processes occurring Surface tension in living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus Summary understanding the behaviour and properties of fluids is Points to ponder important. Exercises How are fluids different from solids? What is common in Additional exercises liquids and gases? Unlike  a solid, a fluid has no definite Appendix shape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume, whereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We have learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids can be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas depends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we talk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume under atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases and solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change in volume due to  change of external pressure is rather small. In other words solids and liquids have much lower compressibility as compared to gases. Shear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its volume fixed. The key property of fluids is that they offer very little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by application of very small shear stress. The shearing stress of fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids. 9.2  PRESSURE A sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it. Our skin, however, remains intact when a blunt object with a wider contact area (say the back of a spoon) is pressed against it with the same force. If an elephant were to step on a man’s chest, his ribs would crack. A circus performer across whose 2024-25 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS 181 chest a large, light but strong wooden plank is In principle, the piston area can be made placed first, is saved from this accident. Such arbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined everyday experiences convince us that both the in a limiting sense as force and its coverage area are important. Smaller lim ∆F the area on which the force acts, greater is the P = ∆A→0 (9.2) impact. This impact is known as pressure. ∆A Pressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the When an object is submerged in a fluid at reader that it is the component of the force rest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This normal to the area under consideration and not force is always normal to the object’s surface. the (vector) force that appears in the numerator This is so because if there were a component of in Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2). Its dimensions are force parallel to the surface, the object will also [ML–1T–2]. The SI unit of pressure is N m–2. It has exert a force on the fluid parallel to it; as a been named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the consequence of Newton’s third law. This force French scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who will cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface. carried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure. Since the fluid is at rest, this cannot happen. A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere Hence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has (atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the to be perpendicular to the surface in contact atmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 × 105 Pa). with it. This is shown in Fig.9.1(a). Another quantity, that is indispensable in The normal force exerted by the fluid at a point describing fluids, is the density ρ. For a fluid of may be measured. An idealised form of one such mass m occupying volume V, pressure-measuring device is shown in Fig. m 9.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with ρ = (9.3) V a spring that is calibrated to measure the force The dimensions of density are [ML–3]. Its SI acting on the piston. This device is placed at a unit is kg m–3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A point inside the fluid. The inward force exerted liquid is largely incompressible and its density by the fluid on the piston is balanced by the is therefore, nearly constant at all pressures. outward spring force and is thereby measured. Gases, on the other hand exhibit a large variation in densities with pressure. The density of water at 4oC (277 K) is 1.0 × 103 kg m–3. The relative density of a substance is the ratio of its density to the density of water at 4oC. It is a dimensionless positive scalar quantity. For example the relative density of aluminium is 2.7. Its density is 2.7 × 103 kg m–3 .  The densities of some common fluids are displayed in Table 9.1.

This force is acting Hence, pressure exerted is same in all vertically down and hence, normally on the directions in a fluid at rest. It again reminds us femurs. Thus, the average pressure is that like other types of stress, pressure is not a F vector quantity. No direction can be assigned P 2 av =  = 2 × 105 N m− ⊳ A to it.  The force against any area within (or bounding) a fluid at rest and under pressure is 9.2.1 Pascal’s Law normal to the area, regardless of the orientation of the area. The French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that Now consider a fluid element in the form of a the pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all horizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar points if they are at the same height. This fact is in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted may be demonstrated in a simple way. at its two ends  must be balanced or the pressure at the two ends should be equal. This proves that for a liquid in equilibrium the pressure is same at all points in a horizontal plane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in different parts of the fluid, then there would be a flow as the  fluid will have some net force acting on it. Hence in the absence of flow the pressure in the fluid must be same everywhere in a horizontal plane. 9.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth Fig. 9.2 Proof of Pascal’s law.

This can also be obtained using the value of ρ in Eq. (9.8). A common way of stating pressure is in terms of cm or mm of mercury (Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a torr (after Torricelli). 1 torr = 133 Pa. The mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine and physiology. In meteorology, a common unit is the bar and millibar. 1 bar = 105 Pa An open tube manometer is a useful (b) The open tube manometer instrument for measuring pressure differences.

The atmospheric cover extends with decreasing pressure over 100 km. We should also note that the sea level atmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of Hg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a sign of an approaching storm. ⊳ Example 9.4 At a depth of 1000 m in an ocean (a) what is the absolute pressure? (b) What is the gauge pressure?

The example below clarifies it. Let us now consider what happens when we change the pressure on a fluid contained in a vessel. Consider a horizontal cylinder with a piston and three vertical tubes at different points [Fig. 9.6 (a)]. The pressure in the horizontal cylinder is indicated by the height of liquid column in the vertical tubes. It is necessarily the same in all. If we push the piston, the fluid level rises in all the tubes, again reaching the same level in each one of them.

No two streamlines can cross, for gives a sketch of turbulent flow. if they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go either one way or the other and the flow would not be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of flow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely spaced streamlines ? If we intend to show streamline of every flowing particle, we would end up with a continuum of lines.

Torricelli discovered that the speed of efflux from an open tank is given by a formula identical to that of a freely falling body. Consider a tank containing a liquid of density ρ with a small hole in its side at a height y  from the bottom (see Fig. 9.10). 1 The air above the liquid, whose surface is at height y , is at pressure P.

This deviation can be partly explained on the basis of Bernoulli’s principle. (i) Ball moving without spin: Fig. 9.11(a) shows the streamlines around a non-spinning ball moving relative to a fluid. From the symmetry of streamlines it is clear that the velocity of fluid (air) above and below the ball at corresponding points is the same resulting in zero pressure difference. The air therefore, exerts no upward or downward force on the ball. Fig. 9.10 Torricelli’s law.

Example 9.7 v  = (v + v )/2 = 960 km/h = 267 m s-1, A fully loaded Boeing aircraft av 2 1 has a mass of 3.3 × 105 kg. Its total wing we have area is 500 m2.

[The density of air is ρ 9.5  VISCOSITY = 1.2 kg m-3] Most of the fluids are not ideal ones and offer some resistance to motion. This resistance to fluid motion is like an internal friction analogous to friction when Answer (a) The weight of the Boeing aircraft is a solid moves on a surface. It is called  viscosity. balanced by the upward force due to the This force exists when there is relative motion pressure difference between layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider ∆P × A = 3.3 × 105 kg × 9.8 a fluid  like oil  enclosed between two glass plates ∆P = (3.3 × 105 kg × 9.8 m s–2) / 500 m2 as shown in Fig. 9.12 (a). The bottom plate is fixed while the top plate is moved with a constant = 6.5 ×103 Nm-2 velocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is (b) We ignore the small height difference replaced by honey, a greater force is required to between the top and bottom sides in Eq. (9.12). move the plate with the same velocity. Hence The pressure difference between them is we say that honey is more viscous than oil. The then fluid in contact with a surface has the same ρ velocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer ∆P = (v2 – 2 2 v1 ) 2 of the liquid in contact with top surface moves where v  is the speed of air over the upper with a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in 2 surface and v  is the speed under the bottom contact with the fixed surface is stationary. The 1 surface. velocities of layers increase uniformly from bottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity ( 2 P v2 – v1) = ∆ ρ( v). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls v2 + v1 ) it forward while lower layer pulls it backward. Taking the average speed This results in force between the layers.
