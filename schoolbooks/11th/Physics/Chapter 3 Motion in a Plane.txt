CHAPTER THREE MOTION IN A PLANE 3.1  INTRODUCTION In the last chapter we developed the concepts of position, displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to 3.1 Introduction describe the motion of an object along a straight line. We 3.2 Scalars and vectors found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be 3.3 Multiplication of vectors by taken care of by + and – signs, as in one dimension only two real numbers directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an 3.4 Addition and subtraction of object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions vectors — graphical method (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above3.5 Resolution of vectors mentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary 3.6 Vector addition — analytical to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector? How to method add, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of 3.7 Motion in a plane multiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this 3.8 Motion in a plane with to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and constant acceleration acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object 3.9 Projectile motion in a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall 3.10 Uniform circular motion discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of Summary motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations. Points to ponder We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail. Exercises The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions. 3.2  SCALARS AND VECTORS In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors.  Basically, the difference is that a direction is associated with a vector but not with a scalar.  A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples are : the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened.  The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided 2024-25 28 PHYSICS just as the ordinary numbers*. For example, represented by another position vector, OP′ if the length and breadth of a rectangle are denoted by r′. The length of the vector r 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its represents the magnitude of the vector and its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the direction is the direction in which P lies as seen four sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m = from O. If the object moves from P to P′, the 3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar vector PP′ (with tail at P and tip at P′) is called and the perimeter is also a scalar. Take the displacement vector corresponding to another example: the maximum and motion from point P (at time t) to point P′ (at time t′). minimum temperatures on a particular day are 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively.  Then, the difference between the two temperatures is 11.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube of aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of 2.7 kg, then its volume is 10–3 m3 (a scalar) and its density is 2.7×103 kg m–3 (a scalar). A vector quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the triangle law of addition or equivalently the Fig. 3.1 (a) Position and displacement vectors. parallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is (b) Displacement vector PQ and different specified by giving its magnitude by a number      courses of motion. and its direction. Some physical quantities that It is important to note that displacement are represented by vectors are displacement, vector is the straight line joining the initial and velocity, acceleration and force. final positions and does not depend on the actual To represent a vector, we use a bold face type path undertaken by the object between the two in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be positions.  For example, in Fig. 3.1(b), given the represented by a symbol v.  Since bold face is initial and final positions as P and Q, the difficult to produce, when written by hand, a displacement vector is the same PQ for different vector is often represented by an arrow placed r r paths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ. over a letter, say v . Thus, both v and v Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of either less or equal to the path length of an a vector is often called its absolute value, object between two points. This fact was indicated by |v| = v.  Thus, a vector is emphasised in the previous chapter also while represented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light discussing motion along a straight line. face A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y. 3.2.2  Equality of Vectors 3.2.1  Position and Displacement Vectors Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and To describe the position of an object moving in only if, they have the same magnitude and the a plane, we  need to choose a convenient point, same direction.** say O as origin. Let P and P′ be the positions of Figure 3.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and the object at time t and t′, respectively [Fig. 3.1(a)]. B. We can easily check their equality.  Shift B We join O and P by a straight line.  Then, OP is parallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that the position vector of the object at time t.  An of A, i.e. Q coincides with O. Then, since  their arrow is marked at the head of this line.  It is tips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are represented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r.  Point P′ is said to be equal.  In general, equality is indicated * Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply and divide scalars of different units. ** In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector unchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of application of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors. 2024-25 MOTION IN A PLANE 29 The  factor λ by  which  a vector A is multiplied could be a scalar having its own physical dimension. Then, the dimension of λ A is the product of the dimensions of λ and A. For example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector by duration (of time), we get a displacement vector. 3.4 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF VECTORS — GRAPHICAL METHOD Fig. 3.2  (a) Two equal vectors A and B.  (b) Two As mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by vectors A′ and B′ are unequal though they definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently, are of the same length. the parallelogram law of addition.  We shall now describe this law of addition using the graphical as A = B. Note that in Fig. 3.2(b), vectors A′ and method. Let us consider two vectors A and B that B′ have the same magnitude but they are not lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.4(a).  The lengths equal because they have different directions. of the line segments representing these vectors Even if we shift B′ parallel to itself so that its tail are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors. Q′ coincides with the tail O′ of A′, the tip S′ of B′ To find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that does not coincide with the tip P′ of A′. its tail is at the head of the vector A, as in 3.3 MULTIPLICATION OF VECTORS BY REAL Fig. 3.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head NUMBERS of B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is, Multiplying a vector A with a positive number λ the sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this gives a vector whose magnitude is changed by procedure of vector addition, vectors are the factor λ but the direction is the same as that of A : λ A = λ A if λ > 0. For example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant vector 2A is in the same direction as A and has a magnitude twice of |A| as shown in Fig. 3.3(a). Multiplying a vector A by a negative number −λ gives another vector whose direction is opposite to the direction of A and whose magnitude is λ times |A|. Multiplying a given vector A by negative numbers, say –1 and –1.5, gives vectors as shown in Fig 3.3(b).

The two vectors Consider the position and displacement vectors and their resultant form three sides of a triangle, in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.1(a). Now suppose so this method is also known as triangle method that an object which is at P at time t, moves to of vector addition. If we find the resultant of P′ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its B + A as in Fig. 3.4(c), the same vector R is displacement? Since the initial and final obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative: positions coincide, the displacement is a “null A + B = B + A (3.1) vector”. The addition of vectors also obeys the associative Subtraction of vectors can be defined in terms law as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(d). The result of of addition of vectors. We define the difference adding vectors A and B first and then adding of two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors vector C is the same as the result of adding B A and –B : and C first and then adding vector A : A – B = A + (–B) (3.5) (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) (3.2) It is shown in Fig 3.5.

Consider  two  vectors A and is also shown in the same figure for comparison. –A shown in Fig. 3.3(b). Their sum is A + (–A). We can also use the parallelogram method to Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the find the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have same, but the directions are opposite, the two vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we resultant vector has zero magnitude and is bring their tails to a common origin O as represented by 0 called a null vector or a zero shown in Fig. 3.6(a). Then we draw a line from vector : the head of A parallel to B and another line from the head of B parallel to A to complete a A – A = 0         |0|= 0 (3.3) parallelogram OQSP.  Now we join the point of Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its the intersection of these two lines to the origin direction cannot be specified. O. The resultant vector R is directed from the The null vector also results when we multiply common origin O along  the diagonal (OS) of the a vector A by the number zero. The main parallelogram [Fig. 3.6(b)]. In Fig.3.6(c), the properties of 0 are : triangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A A + 0 = A and B and we see that the two methods yield the λ 0 = 0 same result. Thus, the two methods are 0 A = 0        (3.4) equivalent. Fig. 3.5 (a) Two vectors A and B, – B is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector B from vector A – the result is R . For 2 comparison, addition of vectors A and B, i.e. R  is also shown. 1 2024-25 MOTION IN A PLANE 31 Fig. 3.6 (a) Two vectors A and B with their tails brought to a common origin.

Example 3.1 Rain is falling vertically with 3.5  RESOLUTION OF VECTORS a speed of 35 m s–1.  Winds starts blowing Let a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a after sometime with a speed of 12 m s–1 in plane with different directions and let A be east to west direction.  In which direction another vector in the same plane (Fig. 3.8). A should a boy waiting at a bus stop hold can be expressed as a sum of two vectors — one his umbrella ? obtained by multiplying a by a real number and the other obtained by multiplying b by another real number. To see this, let O and P be the tail and head of the vector A. Then, through O, draw a straight line parallel to a, and through P, a straight line parallel to b. Let them intersect at Q. Then, we have A = OP  = OQ + QP (3.6) But since OQ is parallel to a, and QP is parallel to b, we can write : Fig. 3.7 OQ = λ a, and QP = µ b (3.7) where  λ and µ are real numbers. Answer  The velocity of the rain and the wind are represented by the vectors v  and v  in      Fig. Therefore, A = λ a + µ b (3.8) r w 3.7 and are in the direction specified by the problem.  Using the rule of vector addition, we see that the resultant of v  and v  is R as shown r w in the figure.  The magnitude of R is R = 2 v + 2 v = 2 2 3 + −1 1 5 12   s = − m 37 m s r w The direction θ  that R makes with the vertical is given by v 12 w tan θ = = = 0.343 Fig. 3.8 (a) Two non-colinear vectors a and b. v 35 r (b) Resolving a vector A in terms of vectors Or,     -1 θ = tan ( a and b. 0.343) = 19° Therefore, the boy should hold his umbrella We say that A has been resolved into two in the vertical plane at an angle of about 19o component vectors λ a and µ b along a and b with the vertical towards the east.       ⊳ 2024-25 ⊳ 32 PHYSICS respectively. Using this method one can resolve and A  is parallel to ɵj ,  we have : a given vector into two component vectors along 2 a set of two vectors – all the three lie in the same A = A  ɵ , 1 x i  A  = A ɵ (3.11) 2 y j plane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector where A  and  A  are real numbers. along the axes of a rectangular coordinate x y system using vectors of unit magnitude. These Thus,    A = A ɵi+ A  ɵ y j     (3.12) x are called unit vectors that we discuss now. A unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and This is represented in Fig. 3.9(c).

Since we are dealing with motion in two in a plane. It can be specified by : dimensions in this chapter, we require use of (i) its magnitude A and the direction θ it makes only two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector, with the x-axis; or say n̂ by a scalar, the result is a vector (ii) its components A  and A x y λ = λn̂.  In general, a vector A can be written as If A and θ  are given,  A and A can be obtained x y using Eq. (3.13). If A and A  are given, A and θ A = |A| n̂ (3.10) x  y can be obtained as follows : where n̂ is a unit vector along A. 2 A + 2 A = 2 2 2 2 x y A cos θ + A sin θ We can now resolve a vector A in terms = A2 of component vectors that lie along unit vectors î  and ɵ Or, A = A2 2 j.

Then, the displacement is : reference frame (Fig. 3.12) is given by ∆r  = r′ – r (3.25) and is directed from P to P′. r = x iɵ + y ɵj We can write Eq.

Now, let the velocity where t is in seconds and the of the object be v0 at time t = 0 and v at time t. coefficients have the proper units for r to Then, by definition be in metres. (a) Find v(t) and a(t) of the v − v0 v − v particle. (b) Find the magnitude and a = = 0 t − 0 t direction of v(t) at t = 1.0 s. Or, v = v0 + at (3.33a) Answer In terms of components : dr d v x = v ox + a x t ɵ 2 v(t ) = = (3.0 t i + 2.0t  ɵj + 5.0 kɵ ) v dt dt y = voy + ayt (3.33b) = 3.0ɵi + 4.0t ɵj Let us now find how the position r changes with dv time. We follow the method used in the onea (t ) = = +4.0ɵj dt dimensional case. Let r  and r be the position o a = 4.0 m s–2 along y- direction vectors of the particle at time 0 and t and let the velocities at these instants be v  and v. Then, At  t = 1.0 s,  o v = 3.0ˆi + 4.0ˆj over this time interval t, the average velocity is (v  + v)/2. The displacement is the average o It’s magnitude is v = 32 + 42 = 5.0 m s-1 velocity multiplied by the time interval : and direction is 2024-25 ⊳ 38 PHYSICS v + v   (v0 + at ) + v0  r − r =  0 = ( 2 5.0 t + 1 5 ) ˆ 2 . t i + 1.0 t ˆ 0 t t j  2  =  2 Therefore, x (t ) = 2 5.0t +1.5t 1 y (t ) = + 2 2 = v0t + at 1.0t 2 Given x (t) = 84 m, t = ? 5.0 t + 1.5 t 2 = 84 ⇒ t = 6 s 1 Or, r = r0 + v0t + at 2 (3.34a) At t = 6 s,  y = 1.0 (6)2 = 36.0 m 2 It can be easily verified that the derivative of  Now, the velocity = dr v = (5.0 + 3.0t )ˆi + 2.0 t ˆj dt dr Eq.
