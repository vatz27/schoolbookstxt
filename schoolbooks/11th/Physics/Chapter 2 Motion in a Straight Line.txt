The sun uniformly accelerated motion itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving 2.5 Relative velocity within its local group of galaxies. Motion is change in position of an object with time. How Summary Points to ponder does the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall Exercises learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity. In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error. In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion. What causes motion described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the subject matter of Chapter 4. 2024-25 14 PHYSICS 2.2  INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED The average velocity tells us how fast an object has been moving over a given time interval but does not tell us how fast it moves at different instants of time during that interval.  For this, we define instantaneous velocity or simply velocity v at an instant t. The velocity at an instant is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small. In other words, ∆x v = lim (2.1a) ∆ t →  0 ∆t Fig. 2.1 Determining velocity from position-time dx (2.1 ) graph.

Then line P1P2 becomes Q1Q2   and its slope right. In the language of calculus, the quantity gives the value of the average velocity over on the right hand side of Eq.

In the limit ∆t → 0, differential coefficient of x with respect to t and the line P P  becomes tangent to the position1 2 dx time curve at the point P and the velocity at t is denoted by  (see Appendix 2.1).  It is the dt = 4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at rate of change of position with respect to time, that point. It is difficult to show this at that instant. process graphical ly.

We see from Table 2.1 that as we decrease Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the the value of ∆t from 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of magnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of the average velocity approaches the limiting + 24.0 m s–1 and a velocity of – 24.0 m s–1 — value 3.84 m s–1 which is the value of velocity at both have an associated speed of 24.0 m s-1.

For this, we must carefully 2.3  ACCELERATION plot the position–time graph and calculate the The velocity of an object, in general, changes value of average velocity as ∆t becomes smaller during its course of motion. How to describe and smaller.  It is easier to calculate the value this change? Should it be described as the rate of velocity at different instants if we have data of change in velocity with distance or with of positions at different instants or exact time ?   This was a problem even in Galileo’s expression for the position as a function of time. time. It was first thought that this change could Then, we calculate ∆x/∆t from the data for be described by the rate of change of velocity decreasing the value of ∆t and find the limiting with distance. But, through his studies of value as we have done in Table 2.1 or use motion of freely falling objects and motion of differential calculus for the given expression and objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is dx calculate  at different instants as done in a constant of motion for all objects in free fall. dt On the other hand, the change in velocity with the following example. distance is not constant – it decreases with the increasing distance of fall. This led to the Example 2.1    The position of an object concept of acceleration as the rate of change moving along x-axis is given by   x = a + bt2 of velocity with time. where  a = 8.5 m, b = 2.5 m s–2 and t is  The average acceleration a  over a time interval measured in seconds. What is its velocity at is defined as the change of velocity divided by t = 0 s and t = 2.0 s. What is the average the time interval : velocity between t = 2.0 s and t = 4.0 s ? v – v Answer  In notation of differential calculus, the a = 2 1 = ∆v (2.2) velocity is t – t ∆t 2 1 dx d where v2 and v1 are the instantaneous velocities v = = (a + bt 2 ) = 2b t = 5.0  t m s-1 or simply velocities at time  t2 and t1 .

On a plot of velocity versus time, the average acceleration is the slope of the straight line x (4.0) − x (2.0) Average velocity = connecting the points corresponding to (v2, t2) 4.0 − 2.0 and (v1, t1). 2024-25 ⊳ 16 PHYSICS Instantaneous acceleration is defined in the (c) An object is moving in negative direction same way as the instantaneous velocity : with a negative acceleration. ∆ (d) An object is moving in positive direction v dv a = lim = (2.3) till time t , 1  and then turns back with the ∆t →0 ∆t dt same negative acceleration.

A velocity may involve either or both of these general proof of this statement requires use of factors.  Acceleration, therefore, may result calculus. We can, however, see that it is true from a change in speed (magnitude), a for the simple case of an object moving with change in direction or changes in both.  Like constant velocity u. Its velocity-time graph is velocity, acceleration can also be positive, as shown in Fig. 2.4. negative or zero.  Position-time graphs for motion with positive, negative and zero acceleration are shown in Figs. 2.4 (a), (b) and (c), respectively.  Note that the graph curves upward for positive acceleration; downward for negative acceleration and it is a straight line for zero acceleration. Although acceleration can vary with time, our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration. In this case, the average acceleration equals the constant value of acceleration during the interval. If the velocity of an object is v  at t o = 0 and v at time t, we have v − v 0 a =   or,  v = v + a t − 0         (2.4) t 0 Fig. 2.3 Velocity–time graph for motions with Fig. 2.2 Position-time graph for motion with constant acceleration.

The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the time axis and the area under it between t = 0 and t = T is the area of the rectangle of height u and base T. Therefore, area = u × T = uT which Fig. 2.5 Area  under v-t curve for an object with is the displacement in this time interval.

For  the car of a particular make, the braking distance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and 50 m corresponding to velocities of 11, 15, 20 and 25 m/s which are nearly consistent with the above formula. Stopping distance is an important factor considered in setting speed limits, for example, in school zones. ⊳ Example 2.7  Reaction time :  When a situation demands our immediate action, it takes some time before we really respond.

SUMMARY 1. An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time.  The position of the object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin.  For motion in a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as negative. The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. 2. Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small : ∆x dx v = lim v = lim = ∆t→0 ∆t→0 ∆t dt The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on position-time graph at that instant. 2024-25 ⊳ 22 PHYSICS 3. Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which the change occurs : ∆v a = ∆t 4. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval ∆t goes to zero : ∆v dv a = lim a = lim = ∆t→0 ∆t →0 ∆t dt The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time graph at that instant of time.  For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the x-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x-t graph is a parabola while the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis. 5. The area under the velocity-time curve between times t and t  is equal to the displacement 1 2 of the object during that interval of time. 6. For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement x, time taken t, initial velocity v , final velocity v and acceleration a are related by a set 0 of simple equations called kinematic equations of motion : v = v  +  at 0 1 x = + 2 v t at 0 2 2 2 v = v + 2ax 0 if the position of the object at time t = 0 is 0.  If the particle starts at x = x  , x in above 0 equations is replaced by (x – x ). 0 2024-25 MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 23 POINTS TO PONDER 1. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration. 2. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is decreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis. 3. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or decreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice of the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is negative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative, results in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative acceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed. 4. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration at that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration. For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity. 5. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (2.9)], the various quantities are algebraic, i.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations (for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs. 6. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3)) are exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (2.9)) are true only for motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during the course of motion. 2024-25 24 PHYSICS EXERCISES 2.1 In which of the following examples of motion, can the body be considered approximately a point object: (a) a railway carriage moving without jerks between two stations.

[Average speed of a particle over an interval of time is defined as the total path length divided by the time interval]. Show in both (a) and (b) that the second quantity is either greater than or equal to the first. When is the equality sign true ? [For simplicity, consider one-dimensional motion only]. 2.10 A man walks on a straight road from his home to a market 2.5 km away with a speed of 5 km h–1. Finding the market closed, he instantly turns and walks back home with a speed of 7.5 km h–1. What is the (a) magnitude of average velocity, and (b) average speed of the man over the interval of time (i) 0 to 30 min, (ii) 0 to 50 min, (iii) 0 to 40 min ? [Note: You will appreciate from this exercise why it is better to define average speed as total path length divided by time, and not as magnitude of average velocity. You would not like to tell the tired man
