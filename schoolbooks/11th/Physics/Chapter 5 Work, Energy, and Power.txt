CHAPTER FIVE WORK, ENERGY AND POWER 5.1  INTRODUCTION The terms ‘work’, ‘energy’ and ‘power’ are frequently used in everyday language. A farmer ploughing the field, a 5.1 Introduction construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful 5.2 Notions of work and kinetic landscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however, energy : The work-energy theorem the word ‘Work’ covers a definite and precise meaning. Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a 5.3 Work day is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a 5.4 Kinetic energy long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is 5.5 Work done by a variable force thus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term ‘energy’ 5.6 The work-energy theorem for is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term a variable force ‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely.

These are 5.8 The conservation of delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to mechanical energy the meaning of the word ‘power’ used in physics. We shall 5.9 The potential energy of a find that there is at best a loose correlation between the spring physical definitions and the physiological pictures these 5.10 Power terms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to 5.11 Collisions develop an understanding of these three physical quantities. Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a Summary mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two Points to ponder vectors. Exercises 5.1.1 The Scalar Product We have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 3. Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are added or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We shall look at the vector product in Chapter 6. Here we take up the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or dot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A.B (read 2024-25 72 PHYSICS A dot B) is defined as A = Ax iɵ + A ɵy j + Azk ɵ A.B = A B cos θ (5.1a) B = B iɵx + B ɵy j + Bzk ɵ where θ  is the angle between the two vectors as shown in Fig. 5.1(a). Since A, B and cos θ are their scalar product is scalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar A.B = (A ˆ ˆ ˆ x i + Ay j + A ).zk (B ˆ ˆ ˆ x i + By j + Bz k) quantity. Each vector, A and B, has a direction but their scalar product does not have a  = Ax Bx + AyBy + AzBz (5.1b) direction. From the definition of scalar product and From Eq. (5.1a), we have (Eq. 5.1b) we have : A.B  = A (B cos θ ( i ) A . ) A = A x A x + Ay Ay + Az Az = B (A cos θ ) 2 = 2 2 2 Or, A Ax + Ay + Az (5.1c) Geometrically, B cos θ is the projection of B onto since A.A = |A ||A| cos 0 = A2. A in Fig.5.1 (b) and A cos θ  is the projection of A (ii) A.B = 0, if A and B are perpendicular. onto B in Fig. 5.1 (c). So, A.B is the product of the magnitude of A and the component of B along u Example 5.1  Find the angle between force A. Alternatively, it is the product of the F = (3 ˆi+4 ˆj-5kˆ )unit and displacement magnitude of B and the component of A along B. d = (5ˆi+ 4 ˆj+3kˆ ) unit.

Consider The following relation for rectilinear motion under a drop of mass 1.00 g falling from a height constant acceleration a has been encountered 1.00 km.  It hits the ground with a speed of in Chapter 3, 50.0 m s-1.  (a) What is the work done by the v2 − u2 = 2 as (5.2) gravitational force ?

We can generalise Eq. (5.2) to three = ×10-3 × 50 × 50 2 dimensions by employing vectors = 1.25 J v2 − u2 = 2 a.d where we have assumed that the drop is initially at rest. Here a and d are acceleration and displacement Assuming that g is a constant with a value vectors of the object respectively. 10 m/s2, the work done by the gravitational force Once again multiplying both sides by m/2 , we obtain is, 1 2 1 mv − mu 2 = m a.d = F.d (5.2b) W = mgh g 2 2       = 10-3 ×10 ×103 The above equation provides a motivation for       = 10.0 J the definitions of work and kinetic energy. The (b) From the work-energy theorem left side of the equation is the difference in the quantity ‘half the mass times the square of the ∆K  =  Wg + Wr speed’ from its initial value to its final value.

Work is done by a force on the body over The object undergoes a displacement d in the a certain displacement. positive x-direction as shown in Fig. 5.2. Equation (5.2) is also a special case of the work-energy (WE) theorem : The change in kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the work done on it by the net force. We shall generalise the above derivation to a varying force in a later section. ⊳Example 5.2  It is well known that a raindrop falls under the influence of the Fig. 5.2 An object undergoes a displacement d downward gravitational force and the under the influence of the force F. opposing resistive force.  The latter is known 2024-25 74 PHYSICS The work done by the force is defined to be Table 5.1   Alternative Units of Work/Energy in J the product of component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement.  Thus W = (F cos θ )d = F.d (5.4) We see that if there is no displacement, there is no work done even if the force is large.  Thus, when you push hard against a rigid brick wall, the force you exert on the wall does no work.  Yet Example 5.3  A cyclist comes to a skidding your muscles are alternatively contracting and stop in 10 m.  During this process, the force relaxing and internal energy is being used up on the cycle due to the road is 200 N and and you do get tired.

It is the variable force, which is more commonly encountered.  Fig. 5.3 is a plot of a varying force in one dimension.

Otherwise the bob will continue on its circular path and complete the revolution.             ⊳ 5.9  THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SPRING The spring force is an example of a variable force which is conservative. Fig. 5.7 shows a block attached to a spring and resting on a smooth horizontal surface.  The other end of the spring is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light and may be treated as massless.  In an ideal spring, the spring force F   is proportional to s x where x  is the displacement of the block from the equilibrium position. The displacement could be either positive [Fig. 5.7(b)] or negative [Fig. 5.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called Hooke’s law and is mathematically stated as F  =  − kx s The constant k is called the spring constant.  Its unit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k is large and soft if k is small.

Note that the work done by the compressed with a displacement x  (< 0).  The external pulling force F is positive since it c overcomes the spring force. spring force does work W − 2 s = kxc /2  while the 2024-25 WORK, ENERGY AND POWER 81 external force F does work + 2 kx / 2 . If the block and vice versa, however, the total mechanical c energy remains constant. This is graphically is moved from an initial displacement x   to a i depicted in Fig. 5.8. final displacement x  , the work done by the f spring force W  is s xf k x 2 k x 2 = − ∫ d = i f Ws k x x   −   (5.17) 2 2 xi Thus the work done by the spring force depends only on the end points.  Specifically, if the block is pulled from x   and allowed to return to x  ; i i x i k x 2 2 ∫ = i k x W   i s = − k x dx        − 2 2 x i = 0 (5.18) Fig. 5.8 Parabolic plots of the potential energy V and The work done by the spring force in a cyclic kinetic energy K of a block attached to a process is zero.  We have explicitly demonstrated spring obeying Hooke’s law. The two plots are complementary, one decreasing as the that the spring force (i) is position dependent other increases. The total mechanical only as first stated by Hooke, (F  = − kx); (ii) s energy E = K + V remains constant.
