PROCESSES – DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM The dynamic nature of  chemical equilibrium can be demonstrated in the Analogous to the physical systems chemical synthesis of ammonia by Haber’s process. reactions also attain a state of equilibrium. In a series of experiments, Haber started These reactions can occur both in forward with known amounts of dinitrogen and and backward directions. When the rates of dihydrogen maintained at high temperature the forward and reverse reactions become and pressure and at regular intervals equal, the concentrations of the reactants determined the amount of ammonia present. and the products remain constant. This He was successful in determining also the is the stage of chemical equilibrium. This concentration of unreacted dihydrogen and equilibrium is dynamic in nature as it consists dinitrogen. Fig. 6.4 (page 174) shows that after of a forward reaction in which the reactants a certain time the composition of the mixture give product(s) and reverse reaction in which remains the same even though some of the product(s) gives the original reactants. reactants are still present.

This can be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students. Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of 30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty. Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1, close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both the cylinders becomes constant. If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product in it at the beginning. 1 2 1 2 (a) (b) Fig.6.3	 Demonstrating	dynamic	nature	of	equilibrium.

If we start with equal initial concentration of H2 and I2, the reaction proceeds in the forward direction and the concentration of H2 and I2 decreases while that of HI increases, until all of these become constant at equilibrium (Fig. 6.5). We can also start with HI alone and make the reaction to proceed in the reverse direction; the concentration of HI will decrease and concentration of H2 and I2 will increase until they all become constant when equilibrium is reached (Fig. 6.5).  If total number of H and I atoms are same in a given volume, the same equilibrium mixture is obtained whether we Fig. 6.4 Depiction of equilibrium for the reaction start it from pure reactants or pure product. N2 g  3H2 g 2NH3 g equilibrium is attained, these two mixtures (H2, N2, NH3 and D2, N2, ND3) are mixed together and left for a while.  Later, when this mixture is analysed, it is found that the concentration of ammonia is just the same as before. However, when this mixture is analysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found that ammonia and all deuterium containing forms of ammonia (NH3, NH2D, NHD2 and ND3) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms (H2, HD and D2) are present. Thus one can conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in the molecules must result from a continuation of the forward and reverse reactions in the mixture.

The Six sets of experiments with varying initial last question in particular is important when conditions were performed, starting with only choosing conditions for synthesis of industrial gaseous H2 and I2 in a sealed reaction vessel chemicals such as H2, NH3, CaO etc. in first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and To answer these questions, let us consider only HI in other two experiments (5 and 6). a general reversible reaction: Experiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed A + B  C + D taking different concentrations of H2 and / or where A and B are the reactants, C and D I2, and with time it was observed that intensity are the products in the balanced chemical of the purple colour remained constant and equation. On the basis of experimental studies equilibrium was attained. Similarly, for of many reversible reactions, the Norwegian experiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was chemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and attained from the opposite direction. Peter Waage proposed in 1864 that the Data obtained from all six sets of concentrations in an equilibrium mixture experiments are given in Table 6.2. are related by the following equilibrium equation, It is evident from the experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen C D K reacted = number of moles of iodine reacted c                     (6.1) AB = ½ (number of moles of HI formed).

Equilibrium constant for the reaction, 4NH3(g) + 5O2(g)  4NO(g) + 6H2O(g) is written as Kc  = [NO]4[H2O]6 / [NH3] 4 [O2] 5 Molar concentration of different species is is far from  constant. However, if we consider indicated by enclosing these in square bracket the expression, and, as mentioned above, it is implied that [HI(g)]2 these are equilibrium concentrations. While eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq writing expression for equilibrium constant, we find that this expression gives constant symbol for phases (s, l, g) are generally ignored. value (as shown in Table 6.3) in all the six cases. It can be seen that in this expression Let us write equilibrium constant for the the power of the concentration for reactants reaction, H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)               (6.5) and products are actually the stoichiometric as,  Kc = [HI]2 / [H2] [I2] = x                (6.6) coefficients in the equation for the chemical reaction. Thus, for the reaction H2(g) + I2(g)  The equilibrium constant for the reverse 2HI(g), following equation 6.1, the equilibrium reaction, 2HI(g)  H2(g) + I2(g), at the same constant Kc is written as, temperature is, K K′ c  = [HI(g)] 2 eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq                   (6.2) c = [H2] [I2] / [HI]2 = 1/ x = 1 / Kc                (6.7) Generally the subscript ‘eq’ (used for Thus, K′ c = 1 / Kc                                                    (6.8) equilibrium) is omitted from the concentration Equilibrium constant for the reverse terms. It is taken for granted that the reaction is the inverse of the equilibrium concentrations in the expression for Kc are constant for the reaction in the forward equilibrium values. We, therefore, write, direction. K If we change the stoichiometric coefficients c  = [HI(g)]2 / [H2(g)] [I2(g)]                 (6.3) The subscript ‘c’ indicates that Kc is in a chemical equation by multiplying expressed in concentrations of mol L–1. throughout by a factor then we must make sure that the expression for equilibrium At a given temperature, the product of constant also reflects that change.
