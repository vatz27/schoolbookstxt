By the mid-nineteenth century, The concept that matter is ultimately European scientists started coming to India made of indivisible building blocks, appeared and modern chemistry started growing. in  India a few centuries BCE as a part of From the above discussion, you have learnt philosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda, that chemistry deals with the composition, born in 600 BCE, originally known by the structure, properties and interection of matter name Kashyap, was the first proponent and is of much use to human beings in daily of the ‘atomic theory’. He formulated the life. These aspects can be best described and theory of very small indivisible particles, understood in terms of basic constituents of which he named ‘Paramãnu’ (comparable matter that are atoms and molecules. That to atoms). He authored the text Vaiseshika is why, chemistry is also called the science of Sutras. According to him, all substances are atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and aggregated form of smaller units called atoms perceive these entities (atoms and molecules)?

Kanda added that there We will get the answer of some of these are varieties of atoms that are as different as questions in this Unit. We will further describe the different classes of substances. He said how physical properties of matter can be these (Paramãnu) could form pairs or triplets, quantitatively described using numerical among other combinations and unseen values with suitable units. 2024-25 Unit 1.indd   3 9/9/2022   4:27:29 PM 4 chemistry 1.1 importance of chemiStry many big environmental problems continue to Chemistry plays a central role in science and be matters of grave concern to the chemists. is often intertwined with other branches of One such problem is the management of the science.

Table	1.2		Definitions	of	SI	Base	Units The metre, symbol m is the SI unit of length. It is defined by Unit of length metre taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458 when expressed in the unit ms–1, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequencyV Cs. The kilogram, symbol kg. is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to Unit of mass kilogram be 6.62607015×10–34 when expressed in the unit Js, which is equal to kgm2s–1, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of c and V Cs. The second symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency VCs, Unit of time second the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1. The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is Unit of electric defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary current ampere charge e to be 1.602176634×10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to As, where the second is defined in terms of V Cs. The Kelvin, symbol k, is the SI unit of thermodynamic Unit of temperature. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value thermodynamic kelvin of the Boltzmann constant k to be 1.380649×10–23 when temperature expressed in the unit JK–1, which is equal to kgm2s–2k–1 where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and V Cs. The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Unit of amount Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the unit mol–1 and of substance mole is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance, symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles. The candela, symbol cd is the SI unit of luminous intensity in a given direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical Unit of luminous value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation intensity candela of frequency 540×1012 Hz, Kcd, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm·W–1, which is equal to cd·sr·W–1, or cd sr kg–1 m–2s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and V Cs. 2024-25 Unit 1.indd   8 9/9/2022   4:27:30 PM Some BaSic conceptS of chemiStry 9 Table	1.3		Prefixes	used	in	the	SI	System multiple Prefix Symbol 10–24 yocto y 10–21 zepto z 10–18 atto a 10–15 femto f 10–12 pico p 10–9 nano n 10–6 micro µ 10–3 milli m 10–2 centi c 10–1 deci d 10 deca da 102 hecto h 103 kilo k 106 mega M Fig. 1.5   Analytical balance 109 giga G 1012 tera T SI system, volume has units of m3.

The mass of a substance is constant, whereas, its weight may vary from one place to another due to change in gravity. You should be careful in using these terms. The mass of a substance can be determined accurately in the laboratory by using an analytical balance (Fig. 1.5). The SI unit of mass as given in Table 1.1 is kilogram. However, its fraction named as gram (1 kg = 1000 g), is used in laboratories due to the smaller amounts of chemicals used in chemical reactions. 1.3.5 volume Volume is the amont of space occupied by a Fig. 1.6  Different units used to express substance.

The temperatures on two scales are related to each other by the following relationship: 9 F  C  32 5 The kelvin scale is related to celsius scale as follows: K = °C + 273.15 It is interesting to note that temperature below 0 °C (i.e., negative values) are possible in Celsius scale but in Kelvin scale, negative Fig. 1.7 Some volume measuring devices temperature is not possible. 1.3.6 Density The two properties — mass and volume discussed above are related as follows: Mass Density = Volume Density of a substance is its amount of mass per unit volume. So, SI units of density can be obtained as follows: SI unit of density = = kg  or kg m–3 m3 This unit is quite large and a chemist often expresses density in g cm–3, where mass is expressed in gram and volume is expressed in cm3. Density of a substance tells us about Fig. 1.8 Thermometers using different how closely its particles are packed. If density temperature scales is more, it means particles are more closely packed. 1.4 Uncertainty in meaSUrement Many a time in the study of chemistry, one 1.3.7 temperature has to deal with experimental data as well as There are three common scales to measure theoretical calculations.

These ideas are discussed below in detail. After defining a unit of measurement such as the kilogram or the metre, scientists agreed 1.4.1	 Scientific	Notation on reference standards that make it possible As chemistry is the study of atoms and to calibrate all measuring devices. For getting molecules, which have extremely low masses reliable measurements, all devices such as metre sticks and analytical balances have and are present in extremely large numbers, been calibrated by their manufacturers a chemist has to deal with numbers as large to give correct readings.

The =9.8  2.51026  uncertainty is indicated by writing the certain digits and the last uncertain digit. Thus, if we = 24.50  108 write a result as 11.2 mL, we say the 11 is = 2.450  107 certain and 2 is uncertain and the uncertainty would be +1 in the last digit.

These are Addition and Subtraction stated below: For these two operations, first the numbers are (1) All non-zero digits are significant. For written in such a way that they have the same example in 285 cm, there are three exponent. After that, the coefficients (digit significant figures and in 0.25 mL, there terms) are added or subtracted as the case are two significant figures. may be. (2) Zeros preceding to first non-zero digit Thus, for  adding  6.65×104  and  8.95×103, are not significant. Such zero indicates exponent is made same for both the numbers. the position of decimal point. Thus, Thus, we get (6.65×104) + (0.895×104) 0.03 has one significant figure and Then, these numbers can be added as follows 0.0052 has two significant figures. (6.65 + 0.895)×104 = 7.545×104 (3) Zeros between two non-zero digits Similarly, the subtraction of two numbers can are significant. Thus, 2.005 has four be done as shown below: significant figures. (2.5 × 10–2) – (4.8 ×10–3) (4) Zeros at the end or right of a number are significant, provided they are on = (2.5 × 10–2) – (0.48 × 10–2) the right side of the decimal point. For = (2.5 – 0.48)×10–2 = 2.02 × 10–2 example, 0.200 g has three significant figures. But, if otherwise, the terminal 1.4.2	 Significant	Figures zeros are not significant if there is no Every experimental measurement has decimal point. For example, 100 has some amount of uncertainty associated only one significant figure, but 100 has with it because of limitation of measuring three significant figures and 100.0 has instrument and the skill of the person making four significant figures. Such numbers the measurement. For example, mass of an are better represented in scientific object is obtained using a platform balance notation. We can express the number and it comes out to be 9.4g. On measuring 100 as 1×102 for one significant figure, the mass of this object on an analytical 1.0×102 for two significant figures and balance, the mass obtained is 9.4213g. The 1.00×102 for three significant figures. 2024-25 Unit 1.indd   12 9/9/2022   4:27:32 PM Some BaSic conceptS of chemiStry 13 (5) Counting the numbers of object, for Here, 18.0 has only one digit after the decimal example, 2 balls or 20 eggs, have infinite point and the result should be reported only significant figures as these are exact up to one digit after the decimal point, which numbers and can be represented by is 31.1. writing infinite number of zeros after placing a decimal i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or Multiplication and Division of 20 = 20.000000. Significant Figures In numbers written in scientific notation, In these operations, the result must be all digits are significant e.g., 4.01×102 has reported with no more significant figures as three significant figures, and 8.256×10–3 has in the measurement with the few significant four significant figures. figures. However, one would always like the results to be precise and accurate. Precision and 2.5×1.25 = 3.125 accuracy are often referred to while we talk Since 2.5 has two significant figures, about the measurement. the result should not have more than two precision refers to the closeness of significant figures, thus, it is 3.1. various measurements for the same quantity. While limiting the result to the required However, accuracy is the agreement of a number of significant figures as done in the particular value to the true value of the above mathematical operation, one has to result. For example, if the true value for a keep in mind the following points for rounding result is 2.00 g and student ‘A’ takes two off the numbers measurements and reports the results as 1.95 1. If the rightmost digit to be removed is g and 1.93 g. These values are precise as they more than 5, the preceding number is are close to each other but are not accurate. increased by one. For example, 1.386. If Another student ‘B’ repeats the experiment we have to remove 6, we have to round and obtains 1.94 g and 2.05 g as the results it to 1.39. for two measurements. These observations 2. If the rightmost digit to be removed is are neither precise nor accurate. When the less than 5, the preceding number is not third student ‘C’ repeats these measurements changed. For example, 4.334 if 4 is to and reports 2.01 g and 1.99 g as the result, be removed, then the result is rounded these values are both precise and accurate. upto 4.33. This can be more clearly understood from the 3. If the rightmost digit to be removed is 5, data given in Table 1.4. then the preceding number is not changed table 1.4  Data to illustrate precision  if it is an even number but it is increased and accuracy by one if it is an odd number. For example, measurements/g if 6.35 is to be rounded by removing 5, we 1 2 Average (g) have to increase 3 to 4 giving 6.4 as the result. However, if 6.25 is to be rounded Student A 1.95 1.93 1.940 off it is rounded off to 6.2. Student B 1.94 2.05 1.995 Student C 2.01 1.99 2.000 1.4.3 Dimensional analysis Often while calculating, there is a need to Addition and Subtraction of convert units from one system to the other. Significant Figures The method used to accomplish this is called The result cannot have more digits to the right factor label method or unit factor method of the decimal point than either of the original or dimensional analysis. This is illustrated numbers.  12.11 below. 18.0 example 1.012 A piece of metal is 3 inch (represented by in) 31.122 long. What is its length in cm? 2024-25 Unit 1.indd   13 9/9/2022   4:27:32 PM 14 chemistry Solution The above is multiplied by the unit factor We know that 1 in = 2.54 cm 2 1000 3 1m3 2 3  m cm  3 3 6 3  3  2 10 m From this equivalence, we can write 10 cm 10 1 in example = = 2.54cm 1 2.54cm 1 in How many seconds are there in 2 days? Solution Here, we know 1 day = 24 hours (h) Thus, 1 in 2.54cm equals 1 and 2.54cm 1 in 1day or = 24 h 1 = 24 h 1day also equals 1. Both of these are called unit then, 1h = 60 min factors. If some number is multiplied by these 1h unit factors (i.e., 1), it will not be affected or = 60min 1 = otherwise. 60min 1h Say, the 3 in given above is multiplied by so, for converting 2 days to seconds, the unit factor. So, i.e., 2 days – – – – – – = – – – seconds 2.54cm 3 in = 3 in ×  = 3 × 2.54 cm = 7.62 cm The unit factors can be multiplied in 1 in series in one step only as follows: 24 h × 60 60s day × min Now, the unit factor by which multiplication 2 × 1day 1 h 1 min is to be done is that unit factor ( 2.54cm  in 1 in  = 2 × 24 × 60 × 60 s the above case) which gives the desired units  = 172800 s i.e., the numerator should have that part 1.5 laWS of chemical which  is required in the desired result. comBinationS It should also be noted in the above The combination of elements example that units can be handled just like to  f o rm compounds  i s other numerical part.

The law of Thus, he concluded that irrespective of the definite proportions, stated earlier, was with source, a given compound always contains respect to mass. The Gay Lussac’s law was same elements combined together in the same explained properly by the work of Avogadro proportion by mass. The validity of this law in 1811. has been confirmed by various experiments. It is sometimes also referred to as law of 1.5.5 avogadro’s law Definite	Composition. In 1811, Avogadro proposed that equal 1.5.3 law of multiple proportions volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure should contain equal number This law was proposed by Dalton in 1803. of molecules. Avogadro made a distinction According to this law, if two elements can between atoms and molecules which is combine to form more than one compound, quite understandable in present times. If the masses of one element that combine with we consider again the reaction of hydrogen a fixed mass of the other element, are in the and oxygen to produce water, we see that ratio of small whole numbers. two volumes of hydrogen combine with one For example, hydrogen combines with volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water oxygen to form two compounds, namely, water without leaving any unreacted oxygen. and hydrogen peroxide.
