Hydrocarbons 295 Unit 9 Hydrocarbons Hydrocarbons are the important sources of energy. After studying this unit, you will be able to • name hydrocarbons according to The term ‘hydrocarbon’ is self-explanatory which means IUPAC system of nomenclature; compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons • recognise and write structures play a key role in our daily life. You must be familiar o f  i s o m e r s  o f  a l k a n e s , with the terms ‘LPG’ and ‘CNG’ used as fuels. LPG is the alkenes, alkynes and aromatic abbreviated form of liquified petroleum gas whereas CNG hydrocarbons; • learn about various methods of stands for compressed natural gas.

Depending upon toxicity. the types of carbon-carbon bonds present, they can be classified into three main categories – (i) saturated 2024-25 Unit 9.indd   295 10/10/2022   10:37:52 AM 296 chemistry ( i i )  unsaturated and ( i i i )  aromat ic of the general formula for alkane family hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons or homologous series? If we examine the contain carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen formula of different alkanes we find that single bonds. If different carbon atoms are the general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. It joined together to form open chain of carbon represents any particular homologue when n atoms with single bonds, they are termed is given appropriate value. Can you recall the as alkanes as you have already studied in structure of methane? According to VSEPR Unit 8. On the other hand, if carbon atoms theory (Unit 4), methane has a tetrahedral form a closed chain or a ring, they are termed structure (Fig. 9.1), in which carbon atom lies as cycloalkanes. Unsaturated hydrocarbons at the centre and the four hydrogen atoms lie contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds – at the four corners of a regular tetrahedron. double bonds, triple bonds or both. Aromatic All H-C-H  bond angles are of 109.5°. hydrocarbons are a special type of cyclic compounds. You can construct a large number of models of such molecules of both types (open chain and close chain) keeping in mind that carbon is tetravalent and hydrogen is monovalent. For making models of alkanes, you can use toothpicks for bonds and plasticine balls for atoms. For alkenes, alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons, spring models can be constructed. Fig. 9.1  Structure of methane In alkanes, tetrahedra are joined together 9.2  ALKANES in which C-C and C-H bond lengths are As already mentioned, alkanes are saturated 154 pm and 112 pm respectively (Unit 8). open chain hydrocarbons containing You have already read that C–C and C–H σ carbon - carbon single bonds. Methane (CH4) bonds are formed by head-on overlapping of is the first member of this family. Methane is sp3 hybrid orbitals of carbon and 1s orbitals a gas found in coal mines and marshy places. of hydrogen atoms. If you replace one hydrogen atom of methane by carbon and join the required number of 9.2.1 Nomenclature and Isomerism hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of the You have already read about nomenclature other carbon atom, what do you get? You of different classes of organic compounds get C2H6. This hydrocarbon with molecular in Unit 8. Nomenclature and isomerism formula C2H6 is known as ethane. Thus you in alkanes can further be understood with can consider C2H6 as derived from CH4 by the help of a few more examples.

However, it may be remembered that rotation around a C-C single bond is not completely free. It is hindered by a small energy barrier of 1-20 kJ mol–1 due to weak repulsive interaction between the adjacent bonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction is called torsional strain.

Thus there are infinite number lines drawn at an angle of 120° to each other. of conformations of ethane. However, there are The Newman’s projections are depicted in two extreme cases. One such conformation Fig. 9.3. in which hydrogen atoms attached to two carbons are as closed together as possible is called eclipsed conformation and the other in which hydrogens are as far apart as possible is known as the staggered conformation. Any other intermediate conformation is called a skew conformation.It may be remembered that in all the conformations, the bond angles and the bond lengths remain the same. Eclipsed and the staggered conformations can be represented by sawhorse and newman projections.

Thus, there are 9.3.1 structure of Double Bond minimum repulsive forces, minimum energy and maximum stability of the molecule. On the Carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes other hand, when the staggered form changes consists of one strong sigma (σ) bond (bond into the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the enthalpy about 397 kJ mol–1) due to head-on carbon – hydrogen bonds come closer to each overlapping of sp2 hybridised orbitals and other resulting in increase in electron cloud one weak pi (π) bond (bond enthalpy about repulsions. To check the increased repulsive 284 kJ mol–1) obtained by lateral or sideways forces, molecule will have to possess more overlapping of the two 2p orbitals of the two energy and thus has lesser stability. As already carbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in mentioned, the repulsive interaction between bond length (134 pm) than the C–C single the electron clouds, which affects stability of bond (154 pm). You have already read that a conformation, is called torsional strain. the pi (π) bond is a weaker bond due to poor Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon sideways overlapping between the two 2p the angle of rotation about C–C bond. This orbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi (π) bond angle is also called dihedral angle or torsional makes alkenes behave as sources of loosely angle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the held mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are staggered form has the least torsional strain easily attacked by reagents or compounds and the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional which are in search of electrons. Such strain. Therefore, staggered conformation is reagents are called electrophilic reagents. more stable than the eclipsed conformation. The presence of weaker π-bond makes alkenes Hence, molecule largely remains in staggered unstable molecules in comparison to alkanes conformation or we can say that it is preferred and thus, alkenes can be changed into single conformation. Thus it may be inferred that bond compounds by combining with the rotation around C–C bond in ethane is not electrophilic reagents. Strength of the double completely free.  The energy difference between bond (bond enthalpy, 681 kJ mol–1) is greater the two extreme forms is of the order of 12.5 than that of a carbon-carbon single bond in kJ mol–1 ethane (bond enthalpy, 348 kJ mol–1). Orbital , which is very small. Even at ordinary diagrams of ethene molecule are shown in temperatures, the ethane molecule gains Figs. 9.4 and 9.5. thermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to overcome this energy barrier of 12.5 kJ mol–1 through intermolecular collisions. Thus, it can be said that rotation about carbon-carbon single bond in ethane is almost free for all practical purposes. It has not been possible to separate and isolate different conformational isomers of ethane. 9.3 Alkenes Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond. What Fig. 9.4 Orbital picture of ethene depicting σ bonds only should be the general formula of alkenes? If there is one double bond between two carbon 9.3.2 nomenclature atoms in alkenes, they must possess two For nomenclature of alkenes in IUPAC system, hydrogen atoms less than alkanes. Hence, the longest chain of carbon atoms containing general formula for alkenes is CnH2n. Alkenes the double bond is selected. Numbering of the are also known as olefins (oil forming) since chain is done from the end which is nearer to 2024-25 Unit 9.indd   306 11/10/2022   15:26:35 Hydrocarbons 307 Fig. 9.5 Orbital picture of ethene showing formation of (a) π-bond, (b) π-cloud and (c) bond angles and bond lengths the double bond.
