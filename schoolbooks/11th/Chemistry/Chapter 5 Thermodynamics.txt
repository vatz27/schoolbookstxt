These are discussed below. 5.1.2 Types of the system 5.1.1 The system and the surroundings We, further classify the systems according A system in thermodynamics refers to that to the movements of matter and energy in or part of universe in which observations are out of the system. made and remaining universe constitutes the surroundings. The surroundings include 1. Open System everything other than the system.

The presence of reactants in an The universe = The system + The surroundings open beaker is an example of an open system*. Here the boundary is an imaginary surface However, the entire universe other than enclosing the beaker and reactants. the system is not affected by the changes taking place in the system. Therefore, for all 2.

Usually, the region between system and the surroundings of space in the neighbourhood of the system [Fig. 5.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a constitutes its surroundings. closed vessel made of conducting material For example, if we are studying the e.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed reaction between two substances A and B system. kept in a beaker, the beaker containing the reaction mixture is the system and the room where the beaker is kept is the surroundings (Fig. 5.1). Fig. 5.1 System and the surroundings Note that the system may be defined by physical boundaries, like beaker or test tube, or the system may simply be defined by a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying a particular volume in space. It is necessary to think of the system as separated from the surroundings by some sort of wall which may be real or imaginary. The wall that separates Fig. 5.2  Open, closed and isolated systems. *  We could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary. 2024-25 Unit 5.indd   137 9/12/2022   11:53:34 AM 138 chemIstry 3. Isolated System a quantity which represents the total energy In an isolated system, there is no exchange of the system.

You would Let us first examine a change in internal energy recall from your Physics course that the by doing work. We take a system containing state of a system in mechanics is completely some quantity of water in a thermos flask specified at a given instant of time, by the or in an insulated beaker. This would not position and velocity of each mass point of allow exchange of heat between the system the system. In thermodynamics, a different and surroundings through its boundary and and much simpler concept of the state of a we call this type of system as adiabatic. The system is introduced. It does not need detailed manner in which the state of such a system knowledge of motion of each particle  because, may be changed will be called adiabatic we deal with average measurable properties of process. Adiabatic process is a process in the system. We specify the state of the system which there is no transfer of heat between by state functions or state variables. the system and surroundings. Here, the wall The state of a thermodynamic system is separating the system and the surroundings described by its measurable or macroscopic is called the adiabatic wall (Fig. 5.3). (bulk) properties. We can describe the state of a gas by quoting its pressure (p), volume (V), temperature (T ), amount (n) etc. Variables like p, V, T are called state variables or state functions because their values depend only on the state of the system and not on how it is reached. In order to completely define the state of a system it is not necessary to define all the properties of the system; as only a certain number of properties can be varied independently. This number depends on the nature of the system. Once these minimum number of macroscopic properties are fixed, Fig. 5.3 An adiabatic system which does not others automatically have definite values. permit the transfer of heat through its The state of the surroundings can never boundary. be completely specified; fortunately it is not Let us bring the change in the internal necessary to do so. energy of the system by doing some work on it. Let us call the  initial state of the system 5.1.4 The internal energy as a state as state A and its temperature as  TA. Let Function the internal energy of the system in state A When we talk about our chemical system be called UA. We can change the state of the losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce system in two different ways. 2024-25 Unit 5.indd   138 9/12/2022   11:53:36 AM THERMODYNAMICS         139 One way: We do some mechanical work, say the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for 1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and example, is a state function, because change thereby churning water. Let the new state in volume of its water is independent of the be called B state and its temperature, as route by which water is filled in the pond, TB. It is found that TB > TA and the change either by rain or by tubewell or by both. in temperature, ∆T = TB–TA. Let the internal (b) Heat energy of the system in state B be UB and the change in internal energy, ∆U =UB– UA. We can also change the internal energy Second way: We now do an equal amount of a system by transfer of heat from the (i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an surroundings to the system or vice-versa immersion rod  and note down the temperature without expenditure of work. This exchange change. We find that the change in temperature of energy, which is a result of temperature is same as in the earlier case, say, TB – TA. difference is called heat, q. Let us consider bringing about the same change in temperature In fact, the experiments in the above (the same initial and final states as before manner were done by J. P. Joule between in section 5.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat 1840–50 and he was able to show that a through thermally conducting walls instead given amount of work done on the system, of adiabatic walls (Fig. 5.4). no matter how it was done (irrespective of path) produced the same change of state, as measured by the change in the temperature of the system. So, it seems appropriate to define a quantity, the internal energy U, whose value is characteristic of the state of a system, whereby the adiabatic work, wad required to bring about a change of state is equal to the difference between the value of U in one state and that in another state, ∆U i.e., ∆U =U2 –U1= wad Therefore, internal energy, U, of the Fig. 5.4 A system which allows heat transfer through its boundary. system is a state function. By conventions of IUPAC in chemical We take water at temperature, TA in a thermodynamics. The positive sign expresses container having thermally conducting walls, that wad  is positive when work is done on the say made up of copper and enclose it in a system and the internal energy of system huge heat reservoir at temperature, TB. The increases. Similarly, if the work is done by the heat absorbed by the system (water), q can be system, wad will be negative because internal measured in terms of temperature difference, energy of the system decreases. TB – TA. In this case change in internal energy, Can you name some other familiar state ∆U = q, when no work is done at constant functions? Some of other familiar state volume. functions are V, p, and  T. For example, if we By conventions of IUPAC in chemical bring a change in temperature of the system thermodynamics. The  q is positive, when heat from 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature is transferred from the surroundings to the is 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight system and the internal energy of the system up to 35°C or we cool the system for a few increases and q is negative when heat is degrees, then take the system to the final transferred from system to the surroundings temperature. Thus, T is a state function and resulting in decrease of the internal energy of the change in temperature is independent of the system. * Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the system. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention. 2024-25 Unit 5.indd   139 9/12/2022   11:53:37 AM 140 chemIstry (c) The general case Let us consider the general case in which solution a change of state is brought about both by (i)  ∆ U = w ad, wall is adiabatic doing work and by transfer of heat. We write (ii) ∆ U = – q, thermally conducting change in internal energy for this case as: walls ∆U = q  + w           (5.1) (iii) ∆ U = q – w, closed system. For a given change in state, q and w can 5.2 aPPlicaTions vary depending on how the change is carried Many chemical reactions involve the generation out. However, q +w = ∆U will depend only on of gases capable of doing mechanical work or initial and final state. It will be independent the generation of heat. It is important for us of the way the change is carried out. If there to quantify these changes and relate them is no transfer of energy as heat or as work to the changes in the internal energy. Let us (isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and q = 0, then see how! ∆ U = 0. The equation 5.1 i.e., ∆U = q + w is 5.2.1 Work mathematical statement of the first law of First of all, let us concentrate on the nature of thermodynamics, which states that work a system can do. We will consider only The energy of an isolated system is mechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work. constant. For understanding pressure-volume It is commonly stated as the law of conservation work, let us consider a cylinder which of energy i.e., energy can neither be created contains one mole of an ideal gas fitted with nor be destroyed. a frictionless piston. Total volume of the gas note: There is considerable difference between is Vi and pressure of the gas inside is p. If the character of the thermodynamic property external pressure is pex which is greater  than energy and that of a mechanical property such p, piston is moved inward till the pressure as volume. We can specify an unambiguous (absolute) value for volume of a system in a particular state, but not the absolute value of the internal energy. However, we can measure only the changes in the internal energy, ∆U of the system. Problem 5.1 Express the change in internal energy of a system when (i) No heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings, but work (w) is done on the system. What type of wall does the system have ? (ii) No work is done on the system, but q  amount of heat is taken out from the system and given to the surroundings. What type of wall does the system have?
