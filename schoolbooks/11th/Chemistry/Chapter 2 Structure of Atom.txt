Before we discuss these results we need to keep in mind a basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged particles : “Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other”. Fig. 2.1(a) A cathode ray discharge tube 2.1.1 Discovery of electron In 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if electricity is passed through a solution of an electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the electrodes, which resulted in the liberation and deposition of matter at the electrodes. He formulated certain laws which you will study in Class XII. These results suggested the particulate nature of electricity. Fig. 2.1(b)  A cathode ray discharge tube with In mid 1850s many scientists mainly perforated anode Faraday began to study electrical discharge in partially evacuated tubes, known as The results of these experiments are cathode ray discharge tubes.

This positively charged particle was characterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt for the presence of electrically neutral particle as one of the constituent of atom. These particles were discovered by Chadwick (1932) by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium by α-particles. When electrically neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than that of protons were emitted. He named these particles as neutrons.

These rays are of very short wavelengths (∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic character (Section 2.3.1). Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed that there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own and named this Fig.2.4 Thomson model of atom phenomenon as  radioactivity and the can be visualised as a pudding or watermelon elements known as radioactive elements. of positive charge with plums or seeds This	 field	was	 developed	 by	Marie	 Curie, (electrons) embedded into it.

According to Thomson 2.2.2 rutherford’s nuclear model of atom model of atom, the mass of each gold atom in the foil should have been spread evenly Rutherford and his students (Hans Geiger over the entire atom, and α–particles had and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin enough energy to pass directly through such a gold foil with α–particles.

It was expected –particle scattering experiment is that the particles would slow down and change directions only by a small angles as they passed through the foil.

For example, considering of is due to the protons in the nucleus. As hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen established earlier, the charge on the proton atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is is equal but opposite to that of electron. The called protium (1 1H). Rest of the percentage of number of protons present in the nucleus is hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, equal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is called deuterium ( 2 1D, 0.015%) and the is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. is called tritium (3 1t ). The latter isotope is In order to keep the electrical neutrality, found in trace amounts on the earth.

As this is Planck arrived at a satisfactory relationship heated further, the radiation emitted becomes white and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. This means that red radiation is most intense at a particular temperature and the blue radiation is more intense at another temperature. This means intensities of radiations of different wavelengths emitted by hot body depend upon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was known that objects made of different material and kept at different temperatures emit different amount of radiation.

The reason for incomplete absorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which emits and absorbs radiations of all frequencies uniformly, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation. In practice, no such body exists. Carbon black approximates fairly closely to black body. A good physical approximation to a black body is a cavity with a tiny hole, which has no other opening.

Planck assumed physics from the University of that radiation could be sub-divided into Munich in 1879. In 1888, he was appointed Director of the discrete chunks of energy. He suggested that Institute of Theoretical Physics atoms and molecules could emit or absorb at the University of Berlin. energy only in discrete quantities and not Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in a continuous manner. He gave the name in 1918 for his quantum theory.

At a frequency ν >ν0, the ejected electrons come out with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic energies of these electrons increase with the increase of frequency of the light used.

Einstein (1905) was able to explain the Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists photoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum of larger number of photons, consequently the theory of electromagnetic radiation as a number of electrons ejected is also larger as starting point. compared to that in an experiment in which a beam of weaker intensity of light is employed. Albert Einstein, a German born American physicist, is regarded Dual Behaviour of Electromagnetic by many as one of the two great Radiation physicists the world has known (the other is Isaac Newton).
