These are made of wood, plastic or metal and are commercially available. Commonly three types of molecular models are used: (1) Framework model, (2) Ball-and-stick model, and (3) Space filling model. In the framework model only the bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule and not the atoms themselves are shown. This model emphasizes the pattern of bonds of a molecule while ignoring the size of atoms. In the ball-and-stick model, both the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls represent atoms and the stick denotes a bond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g., 8.3.2  Three-Dimensional ethene) can best be represented by using springs in place of sticks. These models are Representation of Organic referred to as ball-and-spring model.

Compounds The existing large number of organic compounds and their ever -increasing numbers has made it necessary to classify them on the basis of their structures. Organic Cyclopropane Cyclohexene Cyclohexane compounds are broadly classified as follows: Sometimes atoms other than carbon are also present in the ring (heterocylic). Tetrahydrofuran given below is an example of this type of compound: Tetrahydrofuran These exhibit some of the properties similar to those of aliphatic compounds. (b) aromatic compounds Aromatic compounds are special types of compounds. You will learn about these compounds in detail in Unit 9. These include benzene and other related ring compounds (benzenoid). Like alicyclic compounds, aromatic comounds may also have hetero atom in the ring. Such compounds are called i. Acyclic or open chain compounds hetrocyclic aromatic compounds. Some of the examples of various types of aromatic These compounds are also called as aliphatic compounds are: compounds and consist of straight or branched chain compounds, for example: Benzenoid aromatic compounds CH3CH3 Ethane Isobutane Benzene          Aniline            Naphthalene Non-benzenoid compound Acetaldehyde Acetic acid ii Cyclic or closed chain or ring compounds (a) alicyclic compounds Tropone Alicyclic (aliphatic cyclic) compounds contain carbon atoms joined in the form of a ring 2024-25 Unit 8.indd   261 11/10/2022   15:20:58 262 chemistry Heterocyclic aromatic compounds so because it is found in citrus fruits and the acid found in red ant is named formic acid since the Latin word for ant is formica.

The members of a homologous series can be represented by general molecular formula and the successive members differ from each other in molecular formula by a –CH2 unit. There are a number of homologous series of organic compounds. Some of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, haloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones, alkanoic acids, amines etc. It is also possible that a compound contains two or more identical or different functional groups. This gives rise to polyfunctional compounds. 8.5  nomEnClaturE of organiC Compounds Organic chemistry deals with millions of 8.5.1  the iupaC system of nomenclature compounds.

Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature, however, organic compounds were assigned names based on their origin or certain properties.

While writing the name of the substituents in alphabetical order, these prefixes, however, are not considered. Thus, the following compounds are named as: CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3       CH3-CH-CH2-CH-CH3 CH3 C CH2CH CH3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 2.

For example, the compound(b) is named as 1,3-dibromobenzene and not  as 1,5-dibromobenzene. 2-Chloro-1-methyl-4-nitrobenzene (not 4-methyl-5-chloro-nitrobenzene) (a) (b) (c) 1,2-Dibromo- 1,3-Dibromo- 1,4-Dibromobenzene benzene benzene In the trivial system of nomenclature the terms ortho (o), meta (m) and para (p) 2-Chloro-4-methylanisole 4-Ethyl-2-methylaniline are used as prefixes to indicate the relative positions 1,2;1,3 and 1,4 respectively. Thus, 1,3-dibromobenzene (b) is named as m-dibromobenzene (meta is abbreviated as m-) and the other isomers of dibromobenzene 1,2-(a) and 1,4-(c), are named as ortho (or just o-) and para (or just p-)-dibromobenzene, respectively. For tri - or higher substituted benzene 3,4-Dimethylphenol derivatives, these prefixes cannot be used and the compounds are named by identifying  When a benzene ring is attached to an substituent positions on the ring by following alkane with a functional group, it is considered the lowest locant rule. In some cases, common as substituent, instead of a parent. The name name of benzene derivatives is taken as  the for benzene as substituent is phenyl (C6H5-, base compound. also abbreviated as Ph). 2024-25 Unit 8.indd   269 10/10/2022   10:37:33 AM 270 chemistry Problem 8.10 different carbon skeletons, these are referred to as chain isomers and the phenomenon is Write the structural formula of: termed as chain isomerism.

ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISM In an organic reaction, the organic molecule (also referred as a substrate) reacts with an  A species having a carbon atom possessing appropriate attacking reagent and leads to sextext of electrons and a positive charge is the formation of one or more intermediate(s) called a carbocation (earlier called carbonium and finally product(s) ion).
