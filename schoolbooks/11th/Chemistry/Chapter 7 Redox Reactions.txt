The following reactions represent oxidation processes according to the limited definition of oxidation: 2 Mg (s)  +  O2 (g)  →  2 MgO (s) (7.1) S (s) + O2 (g)  →  SO2 (g) (7.2) 2024-25 Unit 7.indd   235 10/10/2022   10:37:02 AM 236 chemistry In reactions (7.1) and (7.2), the elements broadened these days to include removal magnesium and sulphur are oxidised on of oxygen/electronegative element from account of addition of oxygen to them. a substance or addition of hydrogen/ Similarly,  methane is oxidised owing to the electropositive element to a substance. addition of oxygen to it. According to the definition given above, CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO the following are the examples of reduction 2 (g) + 2H2O (l) (7.3) A careful examination of reaction (7.3) in processes: which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen 2 HgO (s)   2 Hg (l) + O2 (g) (7.8) prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation (removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide ) in terms of removal of hydrogen from it and, 2 FeCl3 (aq) + H2 (g) →2 FeCl2 (aq) + 2 HCl(aq) therefore, the scope of term oxidation was (7.9) broadened to include the removal of hydrogen from a substance. The following illustration is (removal of electronegative element, chlorine another reaction where removal of hydrogen from ferric chloride) can also be cited as an oxidation reaction. CH2 = CH2 (g) + H2 (g) → H3C – CH3 (g) (7.10) (addition of hydrogen) 2 H2S(g) + O2 (g) → 2 S (s) + 2 H2O (l) (7.4) 2HgCl2 (aq) + SnCl2 (aq) → Hg2Cl2 (s)+SnCl4 (aq) As knowledge of chemists grew, it was natural to extend the term oxidation for (7.11) reactions similar to (7.1 to 7.4), which do (addition of mercury to mercuric chloride) not involve oxygen but other electronegative In reaction (7.11) simultaneous oxidation elements. The oxidation of magnesium with of stannous chloride to stannic chloride is fluorine, chlorine and sulphur etc. occurs also occurring because of the addition of according to the following reactions : electronegative element chlorine to it. It was soon realised that oxidation and reduction Mg (s) + F2 (g) → MgF2 (s) (7.5) always occur simultaneously (as will be Mg (s) + Cl2 (g) → MgCl2 (s) (7.6) apparent by re-examining all the equations given above), hence, the word “redox” was Mg (s) + S (s) → MgS (s) (7.7) coined for this class of chemical reactions. Incorporating the reactions (7.5 to Problem 7.1 7.7) within the fold of oxidation reactions In the reactions given below, identify encouraged chemists to consider not only the species undergoing oxidation and the removal of hydrogen as oxidation, but reduction: also the removal of electropositive elements as oxidation. Thus the reaction : (i)  H2S (g) + Cl2 (g) → 2 HCl (g) + S (s) 2K4 [Fe(CN)6](aq) + H2O2 (aq) →2K3[Fe(CN)6](aq) (ii) 3Fe3O4 (s) + 8 Al (s) → 9 Fe (s) + 2 KOH (aq)                                                  + 4Al2O3 (s) is interpreted as oxidation due to the removal (iii) 2 Na (s) + H2 (g) → 2 NaH (s) of electropositive element potassium from potassium ferrocyanide before it changes to Solution potassium ferricyanide. To summarise, the (i) H2S is oxidised because a more term “oxidation” is defined as the addition electronegative element, chlorine is added of oxygen/electronegative element to to hydrogen (or a more electropositive a substance or removal of hydrogen/ element, hydrogen has been removed electropositive element from a substance. from S). Chlorine is reduced due to In the beginning, reduction was considered addition of hydrogen to it. as removal of oxygen from a compound.

As an concept of electronegativity only we illustration, we may further elaborate one of may infer that sodium is oxidised and these, say, the formation of  sodium chloride. hydrogen is reduced. Reaction (iii) chosen here prompts us to 2 Na(s) → 2 Na+(g)   +   2e– think in terms of another way to define Cl2(g) + 2e– → 2 Cl–(g) redox reactions. Each of the above steps is called a half reaction, which explicitly shows involvement 7.2 REDOX REACTIONS IN TERMS OF of electrons. Sum of the half reactions gives ELECTRON  TRANSFER REACTIONS the overall reaction : We have already learnt that the reactions 2 Na(s) + Cl2 (g)  → 2 Na+ Cl– (s) or 2 NaCl (s) 2Na(s) + Cl2(g) →  2NaCl (s) (7.12) Reactions 7.12 to 7.14 suggest that half 4Na(s) + O2(g) →  2Na2O(s) (7.13) reactions that involve loss of electrons are 2Na(s) + S(s) →  Na2S(s) (7.14) called oxidation reactions. Similarly, the are redox reactions because in each of these half reactions that involve gain of electrons reactions sodium is oxidised due to the addition are called reduction reactions.  It may not of either oxygen or more electronegative be out of context to mention here that the element to sodium. Simultaneously, chlorine, new way of defining oxidation and reduction oxygen and sulphur are reduced because to has been achieved only by establishing a each of these, the electropositive element correlation between the behaviour of species sodium has been added. From our knowledge as per the classical idea and their interplay of chemical bonding we also know that sodium in electron-transfer change. In reactions (7.12 chloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide to 7.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as are ionic compounds and perhaps better a reducing agent because it donates electron written as Na+Cl– (s), (Na+)2O 2–(s), and (Na+) to each of the elements interacting with it and 2 S2–(s). Development of charges on the species thus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions and sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising (7.12 to 7.14) in the following manner : agents because these accept electrons from sodium. To summarise, we may mention that Oxidation : Loss of electron(s) by any species. Reduction : Gain of electron(s) by any species. Oxidising agent : Acceptor of electron(s). Reducing agent : Donor of electron(s). Problem 7.2  Justify that the reaction: 2 Na(s) + H2(g) →  2 NaH (s) is a redox change. Solution Since in the above reaction the compound formed is an ionic compound, which may also be represented as Na+H– (s), this suggests that one half reaction in this process is : 2 Na (s) → 2 Na+(g)  +   2e– 2024-25 Unit 7.indd   237 10/10/2022   10:37:03 AM 238 chemistry and the other half reaction is: At this stage we may investigate the state H2 (g) + 2e– →  2 H–(g) of equilibrium for the reaction represented by equation (7.15). For this purpose, let us place This splitting of the reaction under a strip of metallic copper in a zinc sulphate examination into two half reactions solution. No visible reaction is noticed and automatically reveals that here sodium attempt to detect the presence of Cu2+ ions is oxidised and hydrogen is reduced, by passing H2S gas through the solution to therefore, the complete reaction is a produce the black colour of cupric sulphide, redox change. CuS, does not succeed. Cupric sulphide has such a low solubility that this is an extremely 7.2.1 Competitive Electron Transfer sensitive test; yet the amount of Cu2+ formed Reactions cannot be detected. We thus conclude that Place a strip of metallic zinc in an aqueous the state of equilibrium for the reaction (7.15) solution of copper nitrate as shown in Fig. greatly favours the products over the reactants. 7.1, for about one hour. You may notice that the  strip becomes coated with reddish Let us extend electron transfer reaction metallic copper and the blue colour of the now to copper metal and silver nitrate solution solution disappears. Formation of  Zn2+ ions in water and arrange a set-up as shown in among the products can easily be  judged Fig. 7.2. The solution develops blue colour when the blue colour of the solution due to due to the formation of Cu2+ ions on account Cu2+ has disappeared. If hydrogen sulphide of the reaction: gas is passed through the colourless solution containing Zn2+ ions, appearance of white zinc sulphide, ZnS can be seen on making the solution alkaline with ammonia. The reaction between metallic zinc and the (7.16) aqueous solution of copper nitrate is : Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu2+(aq) and Zn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) → Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)     (7.15) Ag+(aq) is reduced to Ag(s). Equilibrium greatly In reaction (7.15), zinc has lost electrons favours the products Cu2+ (aq) and Ag(s). to form Zn2+ and, therefore, zinc is oxidised. By way of contrast, let us also compare Evidently, now if zinc is oxidised, releasing the reaction of metallic cobalt placed in nickel electrons, something must be reduced, sulphate solution. The reaction that occurs accepting the electrons lost by zinc. Copper here is : ion is reduced by gaining electrons from the zinc. Reaction (7.15) may be rewritten as : (7.17) Fig. 7.1  Redox reaction between zinc and aqueous solution of copper nitrate occurring in a beaker. 2024-25 Unit 7.indd   238 11/11/2022   09:48:49 redox reactions 239 Fig. 7.2  Redox reaction between copper and aqueous solution of silver nitrate occurring in a beaker. At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both However, as we shall see later, the charge Ni2+(aq) and Co2+(aq)  are present at moderate transfer is only partial and is perhaps better concentrations. In this case, neither the described as an electron shift rather than a reactants [Co(s) and Ni2+(aq)] nor the products complete loss of electron by H and gain by [Co2+(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured. O. What has been said here with respect This competition for release of electrons to equation (7.18) may be true for a good incidently reminds us of the competition for number of other reactions involving covalent release of  protons among acids.  The similarity compounds. Two such examples of this class suggests that we might develop a table in of the reactions are: which metals and their ions are listed  on the H2(s) + Cl2(g)   →  2HCl(g)     (7.19) basis of their tendency to release electrons and, just as we do in the case of acids to indicate CH 4(g)  +  4Cl2(g)  → CCl4(l)  + 4HCl(g)    (7.20) the strength of the acids. As a matter of fact we have already made certain comparisons. In order to keep track of electron shifts By comparison we have come to know that in chemical reactions involving formation zinc releases electrons to copper and copper of covalent compounds, a more practical releases electrons to silver and, therefore, method of using oxidation number has the electron releasing tendency of the metals been developed. In this method, it is always is in the order: Zn>Cu>Ag. We would love to assumed that there is a complete transfer make our list more vast and design a metal of electron from a less electronegative atom activity series or electrochemical series. to a more electonegative atom. For example, The competition for electrons between various we rewrite equations (7.18 to 7.20) to show metals helps us to design a class of cells, charge on each of the atoms forming part of named as Galvanic cells in which the chemical the reaction : reactions become the source of electrical   0           0              +1 –2 energy.

It is assumed that state of an element in a compound there is an electron transfer from H to O and ascertained according to a set of rules consequently H2 is oxidised and O2 is reduced. formulated on the basis that electron pair 2024-25 Unit 7.indd   239 11/10/2022   15:18:03 240 chemistry in a covalent bond belongs entirely to more bonding state of oxygen but this number electronegative element. would now be a positive figure only. It is not always possible to remember or 4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, make out easily in a compound/ion, which except when it is bonded to metals in binary element is more electronegative than the compounds (that is compounds containing other. Therefore, a set of rules has been two elements). For example, in LiH, NaH, formulated to determine the oxidation and CaH2, its oxidation number is –1. number of an element in a compound/ion. 5. In all its compounds, fluorine has an If two or more than two atoms of an element oxidation number of –1. Other halogens (Cl, are present in the molecule/ion such as Br, and I) also have an oxidation number Na 2 2S2O3/Cr2O – 7 , the oxidation number of the of –1, when they occur as halide ions in atom of that element will then be the average their compounds. Chlorine, bromine and of the oxidation number of all the atoms of iodine when combined with oxygen, for that element. We may at this stage, state the example in oxoacids and oxoanions, have rules for the calculation of oxidation number. positive oxidation numbers. These rules are: 6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number of all the atoms in a compound must be 1. In elements, in the free or the uncombined zero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum state, each atom bears an oxidation of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of number of zero. Evidently each atom in the ion must equal the charge on the ion. H2, O2, Cl2, O3, P4, S8, Na, Mg, Al has the Thus, the sum of oxidation number of three oxidation number zero. oxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the 2. For ions composed of only one atom, the carbonate ion, (CO3) 2– must equal –2. oxidation number is equal to the charge By the application of above rules, we can on the ion. Thus Na+ ion has an oxidation find out the oxidation number of the desired number of +1, Mg2+ ion, +2, Fe3+ ion, +3, element in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear Cl– ion, –1, O2– ion, –2; and so on. In their that the metallic elements have positive compounds all alkali metals have oxidation oxidation number and nonmetallic elements number of +1, and all alkaline earth metals have positive or negative oxidation number. have an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium The atoms of transition elements usually is regarded to have an oxidation number of display several positive oxidation states. The +3 in all its compounds. highest oxidation number of a representative 3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most element is the group number for the first compounds is –2. However, we come two groups and the group number minus 10 across two kinds of exceptions here. (following the long form of periodic table) for One arises in the case of peroxides and the other groups. Thus, it implies that the superoxides, the compounds of oxygen in highest value of oxidation number exhibited which oxygen atoms are directly linked to by an atom of an element generally increases each other. While in peroxides (e.g., H2O2, across the period in the periodic table. In the Na third period, the highest value of oxidation 2O2), each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of –1, in superoxides number changes from 1 to 7 as indicated (e.g., KO2, RbO2) each oxygen atom is below in the compounds of the elements. assigned an oxidation number of –(½). A term that is often used interchangeably The second exception appears rarely, i.e. with the oxidation number is the oxidation when oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In state. Thus in CO2, the oxidation state of such compounds e.g., oxygen difluoride carbon is +4, that is also its oxidation number (OF2) and dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), the and similarly the oxidation state as well oxygen is assigned an oxidation number as oxidation number of oxygen is – 2. This of +2 and +1, respectively. The number implies that the oxidation number denotes the assigned to oxygen will depend upon the oxidation state of an element in a compound. 2024-25 Unit 7.indd   240 10/10/2022   10:37:04 AM redox reactions 241 Group 1 2 13 14 15 16 17 Element Na Mg Al Si P S Cl Compound NaCl MgSO4 AlF3 SiCl4 P4O10 SF6 HClO Highest oxidation +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 number state of the group element The oxidation number/state of a metal in a The idea of oxidation number has been compound is sometimes presented according invariably applied to define oxidation, to the notation given by German chemist, reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing Alfred Stock.

This implies that fluorine is so 2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H reactive that it can replace chloride, bromide 2(g) (7.33) and iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is 0         +1 –2             +2 –2 +1            0 so reactive that it attacks water and displaces Ca(s)  +  2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H2(g) the oxygen of water : (7.34)  +1 –2           0        +1 –1        0 Less active metals such as magnesium and 2H2O (l) + 2F2 (g)  → 4HF(aq)  + O2(g)     (7.40) iron react with steam to produce dihydrogen gas: It is for this reason that the displacement 0         +1 –2             +2 –2 +1  0 reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine using fluorine are not generally carried out in Mg(s)  +  2H2O(l)    Mg(OH)2(s) + H2(g) aqueous solution.

The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number Sometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular element in the compound is in fraction. Examples are: C3O2 [where oxidation number of carbon  is (4/3)], Br3O8 [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)] and Na2S4O6 (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5). We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons are never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the element for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states. Structure of the species C3O2, Br3O8 and S 2 4O – 6  reveal  the following bonding situations: +2    0    +2 O = C = C*= C = O Structure of C3O2 (carbon suboxide) Structure of Br3O8  (tribromooctaoxide)   Structure of S4O 2– 6  (tetrathionate ion) The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation state (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms  of the same element in each of the species. This reveals that in C3O2, two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic picture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br3O8, each of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine is present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is 16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S 2 4O – 6 , each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation state of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four  oxidation numbers of sulphurs of the S4O 2– 6 is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for each sulphur. We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across with fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that this is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in that particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe3O4, Mn3O4, Pb3O4 are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in fraction as in O+ 2 and O – 2 where it is +½ and –½ respectively. 2024-25 Unit 7.indd   245 10/10/2022   10:37:04 AM 246 chemistry (a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing Problem 7.7 equations for oxidation-reduction reactions, Why do the following reactions proceed just as for other reactions, the compositions and differently ? formulas must be known for the substances Pb that react and for the products that are 3O4 + 8HCl → 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O   and formed. The oxidation number method is now Pb3O4 + 4HNO3 → 2Pb(NO3)2 + PbO2 +   best illustrated in the following steps: 2H2O Solution Step 1: Write the correct formula for each reactant and product. Pb3O4  is actually a stoichiometric mixture of 2 mol of PbO and 1 mol of Step 2: Identify atoms which undergo PbO2. In PbO2, lead is present in +4 change in oxidation number in the reaction by assigning the oxidation number to all oxidation state, whereas the stable elements in the reaction. oxidation state of lead in PbO is +2. PbO2 thus can act as an oxidant (oxidising Step 3: Calculate the increase or decrease agent) and, therefore, can oxidise Cl– ion in the oxidation number per atom and for of HCl into chlorine. We may also keep in the entire molecule/ion in which it occurs. If mind that PbO is a basic oxide. Therefore, these are not equal then multiply by suitable the reaction number so that these become equal. (If you realise that two substances are reduced and Pb3O4 + 8HCl → 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O  nothing is oxidised or vice-versa, something can be splitted into two reactions namely: is wrong. Either the formulas of reactants or 2PbO + 4HCl → 2PbCl2 + 2H2O    products are wrong or the oxidation numbers have not been assigned properly).

If the reaction is therefore, it is unlikely that the reaction carried out in acidic solution, use H+ ions in may occur between PbO2 and HNO3. the equation; if in basic solution, use OH– ions. However, the acid-base reaction occurs Step 5 :  Make the numbers of hydrogen between PbO and HNO3 as: atoms in the expression on the two sides 2PbO + 4HNO3 → 2Pb(NO3)2 + 2H2O equal by adding water (H2O) molecules to the It is the passive nature of PbO2 against reactants or products. Now, also check the HNO3 that makes the reaction different number of oxygen atoms. If there are the same from the one that follows with HCl. number of oxygen atoms in the reactants and products, the equation then represents the 7.3.2 Balancing of Redox Reactions balanced redox reaction.
