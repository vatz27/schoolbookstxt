UNIT 4 PLANT PHYSIOLOGY Chapter 11 The description of structure and variation of living organisms over a Photosynthesis in Higher period of time, ended up as two, apparently irreconcilable perspectives Plants on biology. The two perspectives essentially rested on two levels of organisation of life forms and phenomena. One described at organismic Chapter 12 and above level of organisation while the second described at cellular Respiration in Plants and molecular level of organisation. The first resulted in ecology and related disciplines. The second resulted in physiology and biochemistry. Chapter 13 Plant Growth and Description of physiological processes, in flowering plants as an Development example, is what is given in the chapters in this unit. The processes of photosynthesis, respiration and ultimately plant growth and development are described in molecular terms but in the context of cellular activities and even at organism level. Wherever appropriate, the relation of the physiological processes to environment is also discussed. 2024-25 MELVIN CALVIN born in Minnesota in April, 1911, received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota. He served as Professor of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Just after world war II, when the world was under shock after the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings, and seeing the illeffects of radio-activity, Calvin and co-workers put radioactivity to beneficial use. He along with J.A. Bassham studied reactions in green plants forming sugar and other substances from raw materials like carbon dioxide, water and minerals by labelling the carbon dioxide with C14. Calvin proposed that plants change light energy to chemical energy by transferring an electron in an organised array of pigment molecules and other substances. The mapping of the pathway of carbon assimilation in photosynthesis earned him Nobel Prize in 1961. The principles of photosynthesis as established by Calvin are, at present, being used in studies on renewable resource for energy and materials and basic studies in solar energy Melvin Calvin research. 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 133 CHAPTER  11 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 11.1 What do we All animals including human beings depend on plants for their food. Have Know? you ever wondered from where plants get their food?  Green plants, in fact, have to make or rather synthesise the food they need and all other organisms 11.2 Early Experiments depend on them for their needs. The green plants make or rather synthesise the food they need through photosynthesis and are therefore called autotrophs. 11.3 Where does You have already learnt that the autotrophic nutrition is found only in plants Photosynthesis and all other organisms that depend on the green plants for food are take place? heterotrophs. Green plants carry out ‘photosynthesis’, a physico-chemical 11.4 How many process by which they use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic Pigments are compounds.  Ultimately, all living forms on earth depend on sunlight for involved in energy.  The use of energy from sunlight by plants doing photosynthesis is Photosynthesis? the basis of life on earth.  Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it is the primary source of all food on earth. It is also responsible for the release 11.5 What is Light of oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants. Have you ever thought what Reaction? would happen if there were no oxygen to breath? This chapter focusses on 11.6 The Electron the structure of the photosynthetic machinery and the various reactions Transport that transform light energy into chemical energy. 11.7 Where are the 11.1 WHAT DO WE KNOW? ATP and NADPH Used? Let us try to find out what we already know about photosynthesis.  Some 11.8 The C  Pathway simple experiments you may have done in the earlier classes have shown 4 that chlorophyll (green pigment of the leaf), light and CO  are required for 11.9 hotorespiration 2 photosynthesis to occur. 11.10 Factors You may have carried out the experiment to look for starch formation affecting in two leaves – a variegated leaf or a leaf that was partially covered with Photosynthesis black paper, and exposed to light.  On testing these leaves for the presence of starch it was clear that photosynthesis occurred only in the green parts of the leaves in the presence of light. 2024-25 134 BIOLOGY Another experiment you may have carried out where a part of a leaf is enclosed in a test tube containing some KOH soaked cotton (which absorbs CO ), while the other half is exposed to air. 2 The setup is then placed in light for some time. On testing for the presence of starch later in the two parts of the leaf, you must have found that the exposed part of the leaf tested positive for starch while the portion that was in the tube, tested negative. This showed that CO  was required for 2 photosynthesis. Can you explain how this conclusion could be drawn? (a) (b) 11.2 EARLY EXPERIMENTS It is interesting to learn about those simple experiments that led to a gradual development in our understanding of photosynthesis. Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in 1770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air in the growth of green plants. Priestley, you may recall, discovered oxygen in 1774. Priestley observed that a candle burning in a closed space – a bell jar, soon gets extinguished (Figure 11.1 a, b, c, d).  Similarly, a mouse would (c) (d) soon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that Figure 11.1 Priestley’s experiment a burning candle or an animal that breathe the air, both somehow, damage the air.  But when he placed a mint plant in the same bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle continued to burn.  Priestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove. Can you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment using a candle and a plant?  Remember, he would need to rekindle the candle to test whether it burns after a few days. How many different ways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up? Using a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it once in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799) showed that sunlight is essential to the plant process that somehow purifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals. Ingenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not.  Later he identified these bubbles to be of oxygen.  Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that could release oxygen. 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 135 It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch. Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann (1843 – 1909).  Using a prism he split light into its spectral components and then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora, placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O 2 evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and b (discussed  in section 11.4). By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates from CO  and water.  The empirical equation 2 representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving organisms was then understood as: Light CO2 + H2O →[CH2O]+ O2 where [CH O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon 2 sugar). A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by: Light 2H2 A +CO2 →2A + CH2O + H2O In green plants H O is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O . Some 2 2 organisms do not release O during photosynthesis.  When H S, instead 2 2 is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the ‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism and not O . Hence, he inferred that the O evolved by the green plant 2 2 comes from H O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using 2 radioisotopic techniques.  The correct equation, that would represent  the overall process of photosynthesis is therefore: Light 6CO2 +12H2O →C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2 where C  H  O  represents glucose. The O  released is from water; this 6 12 6 2 was proved using radio isotope techniques. Note that this is not a single 2024-25 136 BIOLOGY reaction but description of a multistep process called photosynthesis. Can you explain why twelve molecules of water as substrate are used in the equation given above? 11.3 WHERE DOES PHOTOSYNTHESIS TAKE PLACE? You would of course answer: in ‘the green leaf’ or ‘in the chloroplasts’, based on what you earlier read in Chapter 8. You are definitely right. Photosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so also in other green parts of the plants. Can you name some other parts where you think photosynthesis may occur? You would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the leaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the optimum quantity of the incident light. When do you think the chloroplasts will be aligned with their flat surfaces parallel to the walls? When would they be perpendicular to the incident light? You have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within the chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the stroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 11.2). There is a clear division of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar, which in turn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light driven are called light reactions (photochemical reactions). The latter are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called, by convention, as dark reactions (carbon reactions). However, this should not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not light-dependent.

Looking at plants have you ever wondered why and how there are so many shades of green in their leaves – even in the same plant? We can look for an answer to this question by trying to separate the leaf pigments of any green  plant through paper chromatography. A chromatographic separation of the leaf pigments shows that the colour that we see in leaves is not due to a single pigment but due to four pigments: Chlorophyll a (bright or blue green in the chromatogram), chlorophyll b (yellow green), xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids (yellow to yellow-orange).  Let us now see what roles various pigments play in photosynthesis. Pigments are substances that have an ability to absorb light, at specific wavelengths. Can you guess which is the most abundant plant pigment in the world? Let us study the graph showing the ability of chlorophyll a pigment to absorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure 11.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the wavelength of the visible spectrum of light as well as the VIBGYOR. From Figure 11.3a can you determine the wavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll a shows the maximum absorption? Does it show another absorption peak at any other wavelengths too? If yes, which one? Now look at Figure 11.3b showing the wavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis occurs in a plant. Can you see that the wavelengths at which there is maximum absorption by chlorophyll a, i.e., in the blue and the red regions, also shows higher rate of Figure 11.3a Graph showing the absorption photosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that spectrum of chlorophyll a, b and chlorophyll a is the chief pigment associated the carotenoids with photosynthesis. But by looking at Figure Figure 11.3b Graph showing action 11.3c  can you say that there is a complete one- spectrum of photosynthesis Figure 11.3c Graph showing action to-one overlap between the absorption spectrum of photosynthesis spectrum of chlorophyll a and the action superimposed on absorption spectrum of photosynthesis? spectrum of chlorophyll a 2024-25 138 BIOLOGY These graphs, together, show that most of the photosynthesis takes place in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis does take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum.  Let us see how this happens. Though chlorophyll is the major pigment responsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll b, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments, also absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they not only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised for photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation. 11.5 WHAT IS LIGHT REACTION? Light reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase include light absorption, water splitting, oxygen Primary acceptor release, and the formation of high-energy chemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH. Several protein complexes are involved in the process. The pigments are organised into two discrete photochemical light harvesting Photon Reaction complexes (LHC) within the Photosystem I (PS centre I) and Photosystem II (PS II).  These are named in the sequence of their discovery, and not in the sequence in which they function during the light Pigment reaction. The LHC are  made up of hundreds of molecules pigment molecules bound to proteins. Each photosystem has all the pigments (except one molecule of chlorophyll a) forming a light harvesting system also called antennae (Figure Figure 11.4 The light harvesting complex 11.4). These pigments help to make photosynthesis more efficient by absorbing different wavelengths of light. The single chlorophyll a molecule forms the reaction centre. The reaction centre is different in both the photosystems. In PS I the reaction centre chlorophyll a has an absorption peak at 700 nm, hence is called P700, while in PS II it has absorption maxima at 680 nm, and is called P680. 11.6 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT In photosystem II the reaction centre chlorophyll a absorbs 680 nm wavelength of red light causing electrons to become excited and jump into an orbit farther from the atomic nucleus. These electrons are picked up by an electron acceptor which passes them to an electrons transport 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 139 system consisting of cytochromes (Figure 11.5). This movement of electrons is downhill, Photosystem II Photosystem I in terms of an oxidation-reduction or redox e-potential scale. The electrons are not used up acceptor NADPH Light e-acceptor as they pass through the electron transport NADP+ ADP+iP ATP chain, but are passed on to the pigments of photosystem PS I. Simultaneously, electrons Electron in the reaction centre of PS I are also excited transport when they receive red light of wavelength 700 system nm and are transferred to another accepter molecule that has a greater redox potential. These electrons then are moved downhill again, LHC this time to a molecule of energy-rich NADP+. The addition of these electrons reduces NADP+ LHC to NADPH + H+.  This whole scheme of transfer H2O        2e- + 2H + + [O] of electrons, starting from the PS II, uphill to the acceptor, down the electron transport chain Figure 11.5 Z scheme of light reaction to PS I, excitation of electrons, transfer to another acceptor, and finally down hill to NADP+ reducing it to NADPH + H+ is called the Z scheme, due to its characterstic shape (Figure 11.5). This shape is formed when all the carriers are placed in a sequence on a redox potential scale. 11.6.1 Splitting of Water You would then ask, How does PS II supply electrons continuously? The electrons that were moved from photosystem II must be replaced. This is achieved by electrons available due to splitting of water. The splitting of water is associated with the PS II; water is split into 2H+, [O] and electrons. This creates oxygen, one of the net products of photosynthesis. The electrons needed to replace those removed from photosystem I are provided by photosystem II. 2H2O →4H+ − +O2 + 4e We need to emphasise here that the water splitting complex is associated with the PS II, which itself is physically located on the inner side of the membrane of the thylakoid. Then, where are the protons and O formed 2 likely to be released – in the lumen? or on the outer side of the membrane? 11.6.2 Cyclic and Non-cyclic Photo-phosphorylation Living organisms have the capability of extracting energy from oxidisable substances and store this in the form of bond energy. Special substances like ATP, carry this energy in their chemical bonds. The process through which 2024-25 140 BIOLOGY ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and Photosystem I chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photophosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from e- ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of acceptor light. When the two photosystems work in a Light series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The two photosystems are connected through an Electron transport electron transport chain, as seen earlier – in the system Z scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H+  are synthesised by this kind of electron flow (Figure 11.5). Chlorophyll When only PS I is functional, the electron is P 700 circulated within the photosystem and the phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of Figure 11.6 Cyclic photophosphorylation electrons (Figure 11.6). A possible location where this could be happening is in the stroma lamellae.  While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I and PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP reductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain (Figure 11.6).  The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP, but not of NADPH + H+. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation. 11.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis Let us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the chloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 12). Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the membrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 11.7). (a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids. 2024-25 ADP+iP ATP PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 141 Figure 11.7 ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis (b) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane.  This happens because the primary accepter of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier. Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron.  When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane. (c) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane.  Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH+ H+.  These protons are also removed from the stroma. Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in number, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons.  This creates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable decrease in pH in the lumen. Why are we so interested in the proton gradient?  This gradient is important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the synthesis of ATP.  The gradient is broken down due to the movement of protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane 2024-25 142 BIOLOGY channel of the CF  of the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase enzyme consists 0 of two parts: one called the CF  is embedded in the thylakoid membrane 0 and forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane. The other portion is called CF  and 1 protrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side that faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough energy to cause a conformational change in the CF  particle of the ATP 1 synthase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energypacked ATP. Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton gradient and ATP synthase. Energy is used to pump protons across a membrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within the thylakoid lumen. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of protons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate ATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP. Along with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the ATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic  reaction taking place in the stroma, responsible for fixing CO , and synthesis of sugars. 2 11.7 WHERE ARE THE ATP AND NADPH USED? We learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and O . Of 2 these O  diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to 2 drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars. This is the biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis. This process does not directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products of the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO and H O. You may 2 2 wonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time, and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again. Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark reaction is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves. Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic phase. We saw earlier that CO  is combined with H O to produce (CH O) 2 2 2 n or sugars. It was of interest to scientists to find out how this reaction proceeded, or rather what was the first product formed when CO  is taken 2 into a reaction or fixed. Just after world war II, among the several efforts to put radioisotopes to beneficial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is exemplary. The use of radioactive 14C by him in algal photosynthesis studies led to the discovery that the first CO  fixation product was a 2 3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called Calvin cycle after him. The first product identified was 3-phosphoglyceric acid or in short PGA. How many carbon atoms does it have? 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 143 Scientists also tried to know whether all plants have PGA as the first product of CO  fixation, or whether any other product was formed in 2 other plants. Experiments conducted over a wide range of plants led to the discovery of another group of plants, where the first stable product of CO  fixation was again an organic acid, but one which had 4 carbon 2 atoms in it. This acid was identified to be oxaloacetic acid or OAA.  Since then CO  assimilation during photosynthesis  was said to be of two main 2 types: those plants in which the first product of CO  fixation is a C  acid 2 3 (PGA), i.e., the C  pathway, and those in which the first product was a C 3 4 acid (OAA), i.e., the C  pathway.  These two groups of plants showed 4 other associated characteristics that we will discuss later. 11.7.1 The Primary Acceptor of CO 2 Let us now ask ourselves a question that was asked by the scientists who were struggling to understand the ‘dark reaction’. How many carbon atoms would a molecule have which after accepting (fixing) CO , would have 3 2 carbons (of PGA)? The studies very unexpectedly showed that the acceptor molecule was a 5-carbon ketose sugar – ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).  Did any of you think of this possibility?  Do not worry; the scientists also took a long time and conducted many experiments to reach this conclusion. They also believed that since the first product was a C  acid, the primary 3 acceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying to identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon RuBP. 11.7.2 The Calvin Cycle Calvin and his co-workers then worked out the whole pathway and showed that the pathway operated in a cyclic manner; the RuBP was regenerated. Let us now see how the Calvin pathway operates and where the sugar is synthesised.  Let us at the outset understand very clearly that the Calvin pathway occurs in all photosynthetic plants; it does not matter whether they have C  or C  (or any other) pathways (Figure 11.8). 3 4 For ease of understanding, the Calvin cycle can be described under three stages: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration. 1. Carboxylation – Carboxylation is the fixation of CO  into a stable organic 2 intermediate.  Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle where CO  is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP.  This reaction is 2 catalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation of two molecules of 3-PGA.  Since this enzyme also has an oxygenation activity it would be more correct to call it RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase or RuBisCO. 2024-25 144 BIOLOGY Atmosphere Ribulose-1,5- C0  + H O 2 2 bisphosphate Carboxylation ADP Regeneration 3-phosphoglycerate ATP ATP Reduction + NADPH Triose phosphate ADP + P  +NADP+ i Sucrose, starch Figure 11.8 The Calvin cycle proceeds in three stages : (1) carboxylation, during which CO  combines with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate; (2) reduction, during which 2 carbohydrate is formed at the expense of the photochemically made ATP and NADPH; and (3) regeneration during which the CO  acceptor ribulose2 1,5-bisphosphate is formed again so that the cycle continues 2. Reduction – These are a series of reactions that lead to the formation of glucose.  The steps involve utilisation of 2 molecules of ATP for phosphorylation and two of NADPH for reduction per CO  molecule 2 fixed.  The fixation of six molecules of CO  and 6 turns of the cycle are 2 required for the formation of one molecule of glucose from the pathway. 3. Regeneration – Regeneration of the CO  acceptor molecule RuBP is 2 crucial if the cycle is to continue uninterrupted.  The regeneration steps require one ATP for phosphorylation to form RuBP. 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 145 Hence for every CO   molecule entering the Calvin cycle, 3 molecules 2 of ATP and 2 of NADPH are required.  It is probably to meet this difference in number of ATP and NADPH used in the dark reaction that the cyclic phosphorylation takes place. To make one molecule of glucose 6 turns of the cycle are required. Work out how many ATP and NADPH molecules will be required to make one molecule of glucose through the Calvin pathway. It might help you to understand all of this if we look at what goes in and what comes out of the Calvin cycle. In Out Six CO One glucose 2 18 ATP 18 ADP 12 NADPH 12 NADP 11.8 THE C  PATHWAY 4 Plants that are adapted to dry tropical regions have the C  pathway 4 mentioned earlier. Though these plants have the C  oxaloacetic acid as 4 the first CO  fixation product they use the C  pathway or the Calvin cycle 2 3 as the main biosynthetic pathway. Then, in what way are they different from C  plants? This is a question that you may reasonably ask. 3 C  plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy, they 4 tolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities, they lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity of biomass. Let us understand these one by one. Study vertical sections of leaves, one of a C  plant and the other of a C 3 4 plant. Do you notice the differences? Do both have the same types of mesophylls?  Do they have similar cells around the vascular bundle sheath? The particularly large cells around the vascular bundles of the C 4 plants are called bundle sheath cells, and the leaves which have such anatomy are said to have ‘Kranz’ anatomy. ‘Kranz’ means ‘wreath’ and is a reflection of the arrangement of cells.  The bundle sheath cells may form several layers around the vascular bundles; they are characterised by having a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls impervious to gaseous exchange and no intercellular spaces. You may like to cut a section of the leaves of C  plants – maize or sorghum – to observe the 4 Kranz anatomy and the distribution of mesophyll cells. It would be interesting for you to collect leaves of diverse species of plants around you and cut vertical sections of the leaves. Observe under the microscope – look for the bundle sheath around the vascular bundles.  The presence of the bundle sheath would help you identify the C  plants. 4 2024-25 146 BIOLOGY Now study the pathway shown in Figure 11.9. This pathway that has been named the Hatch and Slack Pathway, is again a cyclic process.  Let us study the pathway by listing the steps. The primary CO  acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol 2 pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme responsible for this fixation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C  acid 4 OAA is formed in the mesophyll cells. It then forms other 4-carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic acid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle sheath cells.  In the bundle sheath cells these C  acids are broken down 4 to release CO  and a 3-carbon molecule. 2 The 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it is converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle. The CO  released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C  or the Calvin 2 3 pathway, a pathway common to all plants. The bundle sheath cells are Figure 11.9 Diagrammatic representation of the Hatch and Slack Pathway 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 147 rich in an enzyme Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), but lack PEPcase.  Thus, the basic pathway that results in the formation of the sugars, the Calvin pathway, is common to the C  and 3 C  plants. 4 Did you note that the Calvin pathway occurs in all the mesophyll cells of the C  plants? In the C  plants it does not take place in the 3 4 mesophyll cells but does so only in the bundle sheath cells. 11.9 PHOTORESPIRATION Let us try and understand one more process that creates an important difference between C  and C  plants – Photorespiration. To understand 3 4 photorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the first step of the Calvin pathway – the first CO  fixation step. This is the  reaction 2 where RuBP combines with CO  to form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is 2 catalysed by RuBisCO. RuBP CO RuBisCo + 2 →2 × 3PGA RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO  and O  – hence the name. Can you think how this could be 2 2 possible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO  when the CO : O 2 2 2
