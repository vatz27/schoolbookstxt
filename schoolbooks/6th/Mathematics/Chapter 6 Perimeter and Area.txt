6 PERIMETER AND AREA 6.1 Perimeter Do you remember what the perimeter of a closed plane figure is? Let us refresh our understanding! The perimeter of any closed plane figure is the distance covered along its boundary when you go around it once. For a polygon, i.e., a closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is simply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance along its outer boundary. The perimeter of a polygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides. Let us revise the formulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares, and triangles. Perimeter of a rectangle Consider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and 8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter? Perimeter of the rectangle = Sum of the lengths of its four sides 12 cm B 8 cm A = AB + BC + CD + DA D Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 129 C 13-08-2024 16:16:29 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 = AB + BC + AB + BC Opposite sides of a = 2 × AB + 2 × BC rectangle are always = 2 × (AB + BC) equal. So, AB = CD and AD = BC = 2 × (12 cm + 8 cm) = 2 × (20 cm) = 40 cm. From this example, we see that — Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth). The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth. Perimeter of a square 1m Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around a square photo frame of side 1m as shown. What will be the length of the coloured tape he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the coloured tape all around the square photo frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the photo frame. Thus, the length of the tape required = perimeter of the square = sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square = 1 m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m. Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length. Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4. Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m. From this example, we see that Perimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side. The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side. 130 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 130 13-08-2024 16:16:29 Perimeter and Area Perimeter of a triangle 4 cm Consider a triangle having three given sides of m 5c lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 7 cm. Find its perimeter. Perimeter of the triangle = 4 cm + 5 cm + 7 cm 7 cm = 16 cm. Perimeter of a triangle = sum of the lengths of its three sides. Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m wide. Find the length of the lace required. Solution Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m. Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m. Akshi wants to put lace all around the tablecloth. Therefore, the length of the lace required will be the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth. Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth = 2 × (length + breadth) = 2 × (3 m + 2 m) = 2 × 5 m = 10 m. Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m. Example: Find the distance travelled by Usha if she takes three rounds of a square park of side 75 m. Solution Perimeter of the square park = 4 × length of a side = 4 × 75 m = 300 m. Distance covered by Usha in one round = 300 m. Therefore, the total distance travelled by Usha in three rounds = 3 × 300 m = 900 m. 131 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 131 13-08-2024 16:16:30 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Figure it Out 1.

What is the total length of rope needed? 132 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 132 13-08-2024 16:16:30 Perimeter and Area Matha Pachchi! 70 m 30 m 40 m 60 m Akshi and Toshi start running along the rectangular tracks as shown in the figure. Akshi runs along the outer track and completes 5 rounds. Toshi runs along the inner track and completes 7 rounds. Now, they are wondering who ran more. Find out who ran the longer distance. Starting Point for Toshi Starting Point for Akshi Each track is a rectangle. Akshi’s track has length 70 m and breadth 40 m. Running one complete round on this track would cover 220 m, i.e., 2 × (70 + 40) m = 220 m. This is the distance covered by Akshi in one round. Figure it Out 1. Find out the total distance Akshi has covered in 5 rounds. 2. Find out the total distance Toshi has covered in 7 rounds. Who ran a longer distance? 3. Think and mark the positions as directed— a. Mark ‘A’ at the point where Akshi will be after she ran 250 m. b. Mark ‘B’ at the point where Akshi will be after she ran 500 m. c.  ow, Akshi ran 1000 m.

How many full rounds has she finished running around her track? Mark her position as ‘Z’.  Deep Dive: In races, usually there is a common finish line for all the runners. Here are two square running tracks with the inner track of 100 m each side and outer track of 150 m each side. The common finishing line for both runners is shown by 150 m the flags in the figure which are in the center of one of the sides of the tracks. 100 m 	 If the total race is of 350 m, then we have to find out where the starting positions of the two runners should be on these two tracks so that they both have a common finishing line after they run for 350 m. Mark the starting points of the runner on the inner track as ‘A’ Common Finishing Line and the runner on the outer track as ‘B’. Estimate and Verify Take a rough sheet of paper or a sheet of newspaper. Make a few random shapes by cutting the paper in different ways. Estimate the total length of the boundaries of each shape then use a scale or measuring tape to measure and verify the perimeter for each shape. Akshi says that the perimeter of this triangle shape is 9 units. Toshi says it can’t be 9 units and the perimeter will be more than 9 units. What do you think? The perimeter is 9 units. No, it will be more than 9 units. 134 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 134 13-08-2024 16:16:31 Perimeter and Area This figure has lines of two different unit lengths. Measure the lengths of a red line and a blue line; are they same? We will call the red lines — straight lines and the blue lines — diagonal lines. So, the perimeter of this triangle is 6 straight units + 3 diagonal units. We can write this in a short form as: 6s + 3d units. Write the perimeters of the figures below in terms of straight and diagonal units. Perimeter of a regular polygon Like squares, closed figures that have all sides and all angles equal are called regular polygons. We studied the sequence of regular polygons as ‘Shape Sequence’ #1 in Chapter 1. Examples of regular polygons are the equilateral triangle (where all three sides and all three angles are equal), regular pentagon (where all five sides and all five angles are equal), etc. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle We know that for any triangle its perimeter A is sum of all three sides. Using this understanding, we can find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = AB + BC + AC = AB + AB + AB B = 3 times length of one side. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = 3 × length of a side. C What is a similarity between a square and an equilateral triangle? 135 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 135 14-08-2024 14:56:30 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Find various objects from your surroundings that have regular shapes and find their perimeters. Also, generalise your understanding for the perimeter of other regular polygons. Teacher’s Note Discuss more about regular polygons and encourage students to come up with a general formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon.

These two pieces are joined in different ways. a. 6 cm 6 cm 6 cm 2 cm For example, the arrangement a. has a perimeter of 28 cm.

Let us recall some key points. The amount of region enclosed by a closed figure is called its area. In previous grades, we arrived at the formula for the area of a rectangle and a square using square grid paper. Do you remember? Area of a square = ________ Area of a rectangle = _______ Teacher’s Note Help students in recalling the method of finding the area of a rectangle and a square using grid papers. Provide square grid papers to students and let them come up with the formula. Let’s see some real-life problems related to these ideas. Example: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted. Solution Length of the floor = 5 m. Width of the floor = 4 m. Area of the floor = length × width = 5 m × 4 m = 20 sq m. Length of the square carpet = 3 m. Area of the carpet = length × length = 3 m × 3 m = 9 sq m. Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m. Therefore, the area of the floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor minus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sq m – 9 sq m = 11 sq m. Example: Four square flower beds each of side 4 m are in four corners on a piece of land 12 m long and 10 m wide. Find the area of the remaining part of the land. 137 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 137 13-08-2024 16:16:31 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Solution Length of the land (l) = 12 m. Width of land (w) = 10 m. Area of the whole land = l × w = 12 m × 10 m = 120 sq m. The sidelength of each of the four square flower beds is (s) = 4 m. Area of one flower bed = s × s = 4 m × 4 m = 16 sq m. Hence, the area of the four flower beds = 4 × 16 sq m = 64 sq m. Therefore, the area of the remaining part of the land is: area of the complete land minus the area of all four flower beds = 120 sq m – 64 sq m = 56 sq m. Figure it Out 1. The area of a rectangular garden 25 m long is 300 sq m.

Hint: In the tangram pieces, by placing the shapes over each other, we can find out that Shapes A and B have the same area, Shapes C and E have the same area. You would have also figured out that Shape D can be exactly covered using Shapes C and E, which means Shape D has twice the area of Shape C or shape E, etc. 6. Can you now figure out the area of the big square formed with all seven pieces in terms of the area of Shape C? 7. Arrange these 7 pieces to form a rectangle.

We can estimate the area of any simple closed shape by using a sheet of squared paper or graph paper where every square measures 1 unit × 1 unit or 1 square unit. To estimate the area, we can trace the shape onto a piece of transparent paper and place the same on a piece of squared or graph paper and then follow the below conventions — 1. The area of one full small square of the squared or graph paper is taken as 1 sq unit. 2. Ignore portions of the area that are less than half a square. 3. If more than half of a square is in a region, just count it as 1 sq unit. If exactly half the square is counted, take its area as 1 sq unit. 2 4. Find the area of the following figures. 140 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 140 13-08-2024 16:16:31 Perimeter and Area Let’s Explore! Why is area generally measured using squares? Why can’t we use circles instead of Draw a circle on a graph sheet with squares to find the diameter (breadth) of length 3. Count area? the squares and use them to estimate the area of the circular region. As you can see, circles can’t be packed tightly without gaps in between. So, it is difficult to get an accurate measurement of area using circles as units. Here, the same rectangle is packed in two different ways with circles — the first one has 42 circles and the second one has 44 circles. Try using different shapes (triangle and rectangle) to fill the given space (without overlaps and gaps) and find out the merits associated with using a square shape to find the area rather than another shape. List out the points that make a square the best shape to use to measure area. 1.

Give examples and reasons for your answer. 6.3 Area of a Triangle Draw a rectangle on a piece of paper and draw one of its diagonals. Cut the rectangle along that diagonal and get two triangles. Check! whether the two triangles overlap each other exactly. Do they have the same area? Try this with more rectangles having different dimensions. You can check this for a square as well. Can you draw any inferences from this exercise? Please write it here. Now, see the figures below. Is the area of the blue rectangle more or less than the area of the yellow triangle? Or is it the same? Why? Can you see some relationship between the blue rectangle and the yellow triangle and their areas? Write the relationship here. Teacher’s Note Help students in articulating their inferences and in defining the relationships they have observed in their own words, gradually leading to a common statement for whole classroom. Recall the definition of a diagonal in the classroom. Draw suitable triangles on grid paper to verify your inferences and relationships observed in the above exercises. 142 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 142 13-08-2024 16:16:32 Perimeter and Area Use your understanding from previous grades to calculate the area of any closed figure using grid paper and — 1.

Area of rectangle ABCD = ________________ So, the area of triangle BAD is half of the area of the rectangle ABCD. What about triangle ABE? There are two halves of two different rectangles. Area of triangle ABE = Area of triangle AEF + Area of triangle BEF. Here, the area of triangle AEF = half of the area of rectangle AFED. Similarly, the area of triangle BEF = h  alf of the area of rectangle BFEC. Thus, the area of triangle ABE =  half of the area of rectangle AFED + half of the area of rectangle BFEC 143 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 143 13-08-2024 16:16:33 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 = half of the sum of the areas of the rectangles AFED and BFEC = half of the area of rectangle ABCD.

Is there any similarity or difference between the two? Using 9 unit squares (having an area of 9 sq units), we have made figures with two different perimeters—the first figure has a perimeter of 12 units and the second has a perimeter of 20 units. Arrange or draw different figures with 9 sq units to get other perimeters. Each square should align with at least one other square on at least one side completely and together all squares should form a single connected figure with no holes. Using 9 unit squares, solve the following. 1. What is the smallest perimeter possible? 2. What is the largest perimeter possible? 3. Make a figure with a perimeter of 18 units. 4. C  an you make other shaped figures for each of the above three perimeters, or is there only one shape with that perimeter? What is your reasoning? Let’s do something tricky now! We have a figure below having perimeter 24 units. Without calculating all over again, observe, think and find out what will be the change in the perimeter if a new square is attached as shown on the right. 145 Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd 145 13-08-2024 16:16:33 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Experiment placing this new square at different places and think what the change in perimeter will be.
