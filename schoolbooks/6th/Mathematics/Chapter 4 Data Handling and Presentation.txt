4 Data Handling and Presentation If you ask your classmates about their favourite colours, you will get a list of colours. This list is an example of data. Similarly, if you measure the weight of each student in your class, you would get a collection of measures of weight—again data. Any collection of facts, numbers, measures, observations or other descriptions of things that convey information about those things is called data. We live in an age of information. We constantly see large amounts of data presented to us in new and interesting ways. In this chapter, we will explore some of the ways that data is presented, and how we can use some of those ways to correctly display, interpret and make inferences from such data! 4.1 Collecting and Organising Data Navya and Naresh are discussing their favourite games. Cricket is my I play cricket sometimes favourite game! but hockey is the game I like the most. I think cricket is the most popular game in our class. Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 74 I am not sure. How can we find the most popular game in our class? 13/08/2024 15:33:11 Data Handling and Presentation To figure out the most popular game in their class, what should Navya and Naresh do? Can you help them? Naresh and Navya decided to go to each student in the class and ask what their favourite game is. Then they prepared a list. Navya is showing the list: Mehnoor – Kabaddi Pushkal – Satoliya (Pittu) Anaya – Kabaddi Jubimon – Hockey Densy – Badminton Jivisha – Satoliya (Pittu) Simran – Kabaddi Jivika – Satoliya (Pittu) Rajesh – Football Nand – Satoliya (Pittu) Leela – Hockey Thara – Football Ankita – Kabaddi Afshan – Hockey Soumya – Cricket Imon – Hockey Keerat – Cricket Navjot – Hockey Yuvraj – Cricket Gurpreet – Hockey Hemal – Satoliya (Pittu) Rehana – Hockey Arsh – Kabaddi Debabrata – Football Aarna – Badminton Bhavya – Cricket Ananya – Hockey Kompal – Football Sarah – Kabaddi Hardik – Cricket Tahira – Cricket She says (happily), “I have collected the data. I can figure out the most popular game now!”. A few other children are looking at the list and wondering, “We can’t yet see the most popular game. How can we get it from this list?”. Figure it Out 1. What would you do to find the most popular game among Naresh’s and Navya’s classmates? 2. What is the most popular game in their class? 3. Try to find out the most popular game among your classmates. 4. Pari wants to respond to the questions given below. Put a tick () for the questions where she needs to carry out data collection and 75 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 75 13/08/2024 15:33:11 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 put a cross () for the questions where she doesn’t need to collect data. Discuss your answers in the classroom. a. What is the most popular TV show among her classmates? b. When did India get independence?  c. 	How much water is getting wasted in her locality?  d. What is the capital of India?  Shri Nilesh is a teacher. He decided to bring sweets to the class to celebrate the new year. The sweets shop nearby has jalebi, gulab jamun, gujiya, barfi, and rasgulla. He wanted to know the choices of the children. He wrote the names of the sweets on the board and asked each child to tell him their preference. He put a tally mark ‘|’ for each student and when the count reached 5, he put a line through the previous four and marked it as ||||. Sweets Tally Marks No. of Students Jalebi |||| | 6 Gulab jamun |||| |||| 9 Gujiya |||| |||| ||| ____________ Barfi ||| ____________ Rasgulla |||| || ____________ Figure it Out 1.	Complete the table to help Shri Nilesh to purchase the correct numbers of sweets: a. How many students chose jalebi? b. Barfi was chosen by c. How many students chose gujiya? d. Rasgulla was chosen by e. How many students chose gulab jamun? students? students? 76 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 76 13/08/2024 15:33:11 Data Handling and Presentation Shri Nilesh requested one of the staff members to bring the sweets as given in the table. The above table helped him to purchase the correct numbers of sweets. 2.	Is the above table sufficient to distribute each type of sweet to the correct student? Explain. If it is not sufficient, what is the alternative? To organise the data, we can write the name of each sweet in one column and using tally signs, note the number of students who prefer that sweet. The numbers 6, 9, … are the frequencies of the sweet preferences for jalebi, gulab jamun … respectively. Sushri Sandhya asked her students about the sizes of the shoes they wear. She noted the data on the board. 4 5 3 4 3 4 5 5 4 5 5 4 5 6 4 3 5 6 4 6 4 5 7 5 6 4 5 She then arranged the shoe sizes of the students in ascending order — 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7 Figure it Out 1. Help her to figure out the following: a. The largest shoe size in the class is _________. b. The smallest shoe size in the class is _________. c. There are _________ students who wear shoe size 5. d. There are _________ students who wear shoe sizes larger than 4. 2. 	How did arranging the data in ascending order help to answer these questions? 3. Are there other ways to arrange the data? Math Talk 77 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 77 13/08/2024 15:33:11 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 4.	Write the names of a few trees you see around you. When you observe a tree on the way from your home to school (or while walking from one place to another place), record the data and fill in the following table: Tree No. of Trees Peepal Neem … …. a. Which tree was found in the greatest number? b. Which tree was found in the smallest number? c. Were there any two trees found in the same numbers? 5.	Take a blank piece of paper and paste any small news item from a newspaper. Each student may use a different article. Now, prepare a table on the piece of paper as given below. Count the number of each of the letters ‘c’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘r’, and ‘x’ in the words of the news article, and fill in the table. Letter c e i r x Any other letter of your choice Number of times found in the news item a. The letter found the most number of times is ________. b. The letter found the least number of times is ________. c. List the five letters ‘c’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘r’, ‘x’ in ascending order of frequency. Now, compare the order of your list with that of your classmates. Is your order the same or nearly the same as theirs? (Almost everyone is likely to get the order ‘x, c, r, i, e’.) Why do you think this is the case? 78 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 78 13/08/2024 15:33:12 Data Handling and Presentation d. Write the process you followed to complete this task. e. Discuss with your friends the processes they followed. f. If you do this task with another news item, what process would you follow? Teacher’s Note Provide more opportunities to collect and organise data. Ask students to guess what is the most popular colour, game, toy, school subject, etc., amongst the students in their classroom and then collect the data for it. It can be a fun activity in which they also learn about their classmates. Discuss how they can organise the data in different ways, each way having its own advantages and limitations. For all these tasks and the tasks under ‘Figure it Out’, discuss the tasks with the children and let them understand the tasks, and then let them plan and present their research processes and conclusions in the class. 4.2 Pictographs Pictographs are one visual and suggestive way to represent data without writing any numbers. Look at this picture — you may be familiar with it from previous classes. Modes of Travelling Number of Students = 1 Student Private car Public bus School bus Cycle Walking This picture helps you understand at a glance the different modes of travel used by students. Based on this picture, answer the following questions: 79 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 79 13/08/2024 15:33:12 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 •• Which mode of travel is used by the most number of students? •• Which mode of travel is used by the least number of students? A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps answer questions about data with just a quick glance. In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol ( ) is used to represent one student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or symbol stands for many people or objects. Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of his middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least 9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data: Response Number of Children ( = 10 Children) Always Sometimes Never Answer the following questions using the pictograph: 1.  hat is the number of children who always slept at least 9 W hours at night? 2. How many children sometimes slept at least 9 hours at night? 3. How many children always slept less than 9 hours each night? Explain how you got your answer. Solutions 1. for ‘Always’. Each picture In the table, there are 5 pictures represents 10 children. Therefore, 5 pictures indicate 5 × 10 = 50 children. 2. (2 × 10 = 20) and a half There are 2 complete pictures picture (half of 10 = 5). Therefore, the number of children who sleep at least 9 hours only sometimes is 20 + 5 = 25. 80 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 80 13/08/2024 15:33:12 Data Handling and Presentation 3. There are 4 complete pictures for ‘Never’. Hence, 4 × 10 = 40 children never sleep at least 9 hours in a night, i.e., they always sleep less than 9 hours. Drawing a Pictograph One day, Lakhanpal collected data on how many students were absent in each class: Class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 No. of students 3 5 4 2 0 1 5 7 He created a pictograph to present this data and decided to show 1 student as in the pictograph — = 1 student VIII Classes VII VI V IV III II I No. of students absent Meanwhile, his friends Jarina and Sangita collected data on how many students were present in each class: Class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 No. of students 30 35 20 25 30 25 30 20 81 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 81 13/08/2024 15:33:12 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 If they want to show their data through a pictograph, where they for each student, as Lakhanpal did, what are also use one symbol the challenges they might face? Jarina made a plan to address this — since there were many to represent 5 students. She figured students, she decided to use that would save time and space too. = 5 students VIII Classes VII VI V IV III II I No. of students present Sangita decided to use one to represent 10 students instead. to show 10 students, she had a problem in Since she used one showing 25 students and 35 students in the pictograph. Then, she to show 5 students. realised she could use = 10 students VIII Classes VII VI V IV III II I No. of students present 82 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 82 13/08/2024 15:33:12 Data Handling and Presentation What could be the problems faced in preparing such a pictograph, if the total number of students present in a class is 33 or 27? Math Talk •• Pictographs are a nice visual and suggestive way to represent data. They represent data through pictures of objects. •• Pictographs can help answer questions and make inferences about data with just a quick glance (in the examples above— about favourite games, favourite colours, most common modes of conveyance, number of students absent, etc.). By reading a pictograph, we can quickly understand the ••  frequencies of the different categories (for example, cricket, hockey, etc.) and the comparisons of these frequencies. •• In a pictograph, the categories can be arranged horizontlly or vertically. For each category, simple pictures and symbols are then drawn in the designated columns or rows according to the frequency of that category. •• A scale or key (for example, : 1 student or : 5 students) is added to show what each symbol or picture represents. Each symbol or picture can represent one unit or multiple units. •• It can be more challenging to prepare a pictograph when the amount of data is large or when the frequencies are not exact multiples of the scale or key. Figure it Out 1.

The number of kites he sold to these six shopkeepers are given below — Shopkeeper Number of Kites Sold Chaman 250 Rani 300 Rukhsana 100 Jasmeet 450 Jetha Lal 250 Poonam Ben 700 84 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 84 13/08/2024 15:33:13 Data Handling and Presentation Prepare a pictograph using the symbol to represent 100 kites. Answer the following questions: a. How many symbols represent the kites that Rani purchased? b. Who purchased the maximum number of kites? c. Who purchased more kites, Jasmeet or Chaman? d.  Rukhsana says Poonam Ben purchased more than double the number of kites that Rani purchased. Is she correct? Why? 4.3 Bar Graphs Have you seen graphs like this on TV or in a newspaper? Like pictographs, such bar graphs can help us to quickly understand and interpret information, such as the highest value, the comparison of values of different categories, etc. However, when the amount of data is large, presenting it by a pictograph is not only time consuming but Source: https://www.statista.com/chart/17122/ number-of-threatened-species-red-list/ at times difficult too. Let us see how data can be presented instead using a bar graph. Let’s take the data collected by Lakhanpal earlier, regarding the number of students absent on one day in each class: Class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 No. of students 3 5 4 2 0 1 5 7 85 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 85 14-08-2024 14:47:51 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 He presented the same data using a bar graph: 1 unit length = 1 student No. of students absent in each class 8 Number of students 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Class Teacher’s Note If the students have not noticed, please point out the equally spaced horizontal lines. Explain that this means that each pair of consecutive numbers on the left has the same gap. Answer the following questions using the bar graph: 1. In Class 2, ___________ students were absent that day. 2. I n which class were the maximum number of students absent? ___________ 3. Which class had full attendance that day? ___________ When making bar graphs, bars of uniform width can be drawn horizontally or vertically with equal spacing between them; then the 86 Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 86 13/08/2024 15:33:14 Data Handling and Presentation length or height of each bar represents the given number. As we saw in pictographs, we can use a scale or key when the frequencies are larger. Let us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing in Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day. The number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from 6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph. One unit of length stands for 100 vehicles. 11–12 Time intervals 10–11 9–10 8–9 7–8 1200 1100 1000 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 6–7 Number of vehicles
