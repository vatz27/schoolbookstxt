10 THE OTHER SIDE OF ZERO Integers More and more numbers! Recall that the very first numbers we learned about in the study of mathematics were the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, … Then we learned that there are even more numbers! For example, there is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before 1. The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the world. For example, around the world we learn to write numbers in the Indian number system using the digits 0 to 9, allowing us to write numbers however large or however small using just these 10 digits. We then learned about more numbers that exist between the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … , such as 1 , 3 , and 13 . These are called 2 2 6 fractions. But are there still more numbers? Well, 0 is an additional number that we didn’t know about earlier, and it comes before 1 and is less than 1. Are there perhaps more numbers that come before 0 and are less than 0? Phrased another way, we have seen the number line: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 However, this is actually only a number ‘ray’, in the language we learned earlier in geometry; this ray starts at 0 and goes forever to the right. Do there exist numbers to the left of 0, so that this number ray can be completed to a true number line? That is what we will investigate in this chapter! Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 242 13-08-2024 17:32:05 The Other Side of Zero Can there be a number less than 0? Can you think of any ways to have less than 0 of something? 10.1 Bela’s Building of Fun Children flock to Bela’s ice cream factory to see and taste her tasty ice cream. To make it even more fun for them, Bela purchased a multistoried building and filled it with attractions. She named it Bela’s Building of Fun. But this was no ordinary building! Observe that some of the floors in the ‘Building of Fun’ are below the ground. What are the shops that you find on these floors? What is there on the ground floor? A lift is used to go up and down between the floors. It has two buttons: ‘+’ to go up and ‘–’ to go down. Can you spot the lift? To go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you must press the ‘+’ button twice. We say that the button press is + + or + 2. To go down two floors, you must press the ‘–’ button twice, which we write as – – or – 2. So if you press + 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘+’ button once), then you will go up one floor and if you press – 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘–’ button once), then you will go down 1 floor. Lift button presses and numbers: +++ is written as + 3 – – – – is written as – 4 What do you press to go four floors up? What do you press to go three floors down? 243 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 243 13-08-2024 17:32:06 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Numbering the floors in the building of fun Entry to the ‘Building of Fun’ is at the ground floor level and is called the ‘Welcome Hall’. Starting from the ground floor, you can reach the Food Court by pressing + 1 and can reach the Art Centre by pressing + 2. So, we can say that the Food Court is on Floor + 1 and that the Art Centre is on Floor + 2. Starting from the ground floor, you must press – 1 to reach the Toy Store. So, the Toy Store is on Floor – 1 similarly starting from the ground floor, you must press – 2 to reach the Video Games shop. So, the Video Games shop is on Floor – 2. The ground floor is called Floor 0. Can you see why? Number all the floors in the Building of Fun. Did you notice that + 3 is the floor number of the Book Store, but it is also the number of floors you move when you press + 3? Similarly, – 3 is the floor number but it is also the number of floors you go down when you press – 3, i.e., when you press – – – . A number with a ‘+’ sign in front is called a positive number. A number with a ‘–’ sign in front is called a negative number. In the ‘Building of Fun’, the floors are numbered using the ground floor, Floor 0, as a reference or starting point. The floors above the ground floor are numbered with positive numbers. To get to them from the ground floor, one must press the ‘+’ button some number of times. The floors below the ground are numbered with negative numbers. To get to them from the ground floor, one must press the ‘–’ button some number of times. Zero is neither a positive nor a negative number. We do not put a ‘+’ or ‘–’ sign in front of it. 244 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 244 13-08-2024 17:32:07 The Other Side of Zero Addition to keep track of movement Start from the Food Court and press + 2 in the lift. Where will you reach? ____________ We can describe this using an expression: Starting Floor + Movement = Target Floor. The starting floor is + 1 (Food Court) and the number of button presses is + 2. Therefore, you reach the target floor (+ 1) + (+ 2) = + 3 (Book Store). Figure it Out 1. You start from Floor + 2 and press – 3 in the lift. Where will you reach? Write an expression for this movement. 2. Evaluate these expressions (you may think of them as Starting Floor + Movement by referring to the Building of Fun). a. (+ 1) + (+ 4) = _______ b. (+ 4) + (+ 1) = _______ d. (– 1) + (+ 2) = _______ c. (+ 4) + (–  3) = _______ e. (– 1) + (+ 1) = _______ f. 0 + (+ 2) = _________ g. 0 + (– 2) = _________ 3.	Starting from different floors, find the movements required to reach Floor – 5. For example, if I start at Floor + 2, I must press – 7 to reach Floor – 5. The expression is (+ 2) + (– 7) = – 5. Find more such starting positions and the movements needed to reach Floor – 5 and write the expressions. Combining button presses is also addition Gurmit was in the Toy Store and wanted to go down two floors. But by mistake he pressed the ‘+’ button two times. He realised his mistake and quickly pressed the ‘–’ button three times. How many floors below or above the Toy Store will Gurmit reach? Gurmit will go one floor down. We can show the movement resulting from combining button presses as an expression: (+ 2) + (– 3) = – 1. 245 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 245 13-08-2024 17:32:07 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 Figure it out Evaluate these expressions by thinking of them as the resulting movement of combining button presses: a. (+ 1) + (+ 4) = _____________ c. (+ 4) + (–  3) + (– 2) = _______ b. (+ 4) + (+ 1) = _____________ d. (– 1) + (+ 2) + (– 3) = _______ Back to zero! On the ground floor, Basant is in a great hurry and by mistake he presses +3. What can he do to cancel it and stay on the ground floor? He can cancel it by pressing – 3. That is, (+3) + (– 3) = 0. We call – 3 the inverse of +3. Similarly, the inverse of – 3 is +3. If Basant now presses +4 and then presses – 4 in the lift, where will he reach? Here is another way to think of the concept of inverse. If you are at Floor +4 and you press its inverse – 4, then you are back to zero, the ground floor! If you are at Floor – 2 and press its inverse +2, then you go to (– 2) + (+2) = 0, again the ground floor! Write the inverses of these numbers: +4, –4, –3, 0, +2, –1. Connect the inverses by drawing lines. +5 –7 –8 +9 –9 +8 –5 +7 Comparing numbers using floors Who is on the lowest floor? 1. Jay is in the Art Centre. So, he is on Floor +2. 2. Asin is in the Sports Centre. So, she is on Floor ___. 3. Binnu is in the Cinema Centre. So, she is on Floor ____. 4. Aman is in the Toys Store. So, he is on Floor ____. 246 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 246 13-08-2024 17:32:08 The Other Side of Zero Floor +3 is lower than Floor +4. So, we write +3 < +4. We also write +4 > +3. Should we write –3 < – 4 or – 4 < – 3? H Floor – 4 is lower than Floor – 3. So, – 4 < – 3. It is also correct to write – 3 > – 4 Figure it Out 1. Compare the following numbers using the Building of Fun and fill in the boxes with < or >. a. – 2 +5 b. – 5 +4 c. – 5 –3 d. + 6 –6 e. 0 –4 f. +4 0 Notice that all negative number floors are below Floor 0. So, all negative numbers are less than 0. All the positive number floors are above Floor 0. So, all positive numbers are greater than 0. 2. 3. 4.

Compare the numbers and fill in the boxes with < or >: a. – 10 – 12 b. + 17 – 10 c. 0 – 20 d. +9 –9 e. – 25 –7 f. + 15 – 17 If Floor A = – 12, Floor D = – 1 and Floor E = + 1 in the building shown on the right as a line, find the numbers of Floors B, C, F, G, and H. Mark the following floors of the building shown on the right. a. – 7 b. –  4 c. + 3 d. –  10 C B A –12 Subtraction to find which button to press In earlier classes, we understood the meaning of subtraction as ‘take away’. For example, there are 10 books on the shelf. I take away 4 books. How many are left on the shelf? We can express the answer using subtraction: 10 – 4 = 6 or ‘Ten take away four is six.’ 247 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 247 13-08-2024 17:32:08 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 You may also be familiar with another meaning of subtraction which is related to comparison or making quantities equal. For example, consider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6. Now, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my sister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ We can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10 Or 10 – 6 = ? Here, we see the connection between ‘finding the missing number to be added’ and subtraction. For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use this meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing number to be added’. Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective. Teacher’s Note In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels, what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) or negative (for a decrease). Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the Sports Centre. What should be your button press? You need to go three floors up, so you should press + 3. We can write this as an expression using subtraction: Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed. In the above example, the starting floor is + 2 (Art Centre) and the target floor is + 5. The button press to get to + 5 from + 2 is + 3. Therefore, (+ 5) – (+ 2) = + 3 248 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 248 13-08-2024 17:32:08 The Other Side of Zero Explanation Recall the connection between addition and subtraction. For 3 + ? = 5, we can find the missing number using subtraction: 5 – 3 = 2. That is, subtraction is the same as finding the missing number to be added. We know that — Starting Floor + Movement needed = Target Floor If the movement needed is to be found, then, Starting Floor + ? = Target Floor So, Target Floor – Starting Floor = ? = Movement needed More examples: a. If the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting Floor is – 2, what button should you press? You need to go one floor up, so, you should press + 1. Expression: (– 1) – (– 2) = (+1) b. If the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting floor is +3, what button should you press? You need to go four floors down, so, you should press – 4. Expression: (– 1) – (+ 3) = (– 4) c. If the Target Floor is +2 and Starting Floor is – 2, what button should you press? You need to go four floors up, so, you should press +4. Expression: (+ 2) – (– 2) = (+ 4) Figure it Out  omplete these expressions. You may think of them as finding the C movement needed to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor. a. c. e. g. i.

The truck is at the ground level, but the minerals are present both above and below the ground level. There is a fast moving lift which moves up and down in a mineshaft carrying people and ore. Some of the levels are marked in the picture. The ground level is marked 0. Levels above the ground are marked by positive numbers and levels below the ground are marked by negative numbers. The number indicates how many metres above or below the ground level it is. In the mine, just like in the Building of Fun: Starting Level + Movement = Target Level For example, (+ 40) + (+ 60) = + 100 (– 90) + (– 55) = – 145 Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed For example, (+ 40) – (– 50) = + 90 (– 90) – (+ 40) = – 130 How many negative numbers are there? Bela’s Building of Fun had only six floors above and five floors below. That is numbers – 5 to + 6. In the mine above, we have numbers from – 200 to + 180. But we can imagine larger buildings or mineshafts. Just as positive numbers + 1, + 2, + 3, ... keep going up without an end, similarly, negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, ... keep going down. Positive and negative numbers, with zero, are called integers. They go both ways from 0: … – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … – 250 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 250 13-08-2024 17:32:08 The Other Side of Zero +1000 +900 +800 +700 Figure it Out Complete these expressions. a. c. e. g.

(+ 200) – (+ 40) = _______ +600 Check your answers by thinking about the movement in the mineshaft. +500 Adding, subtracting, and comparing any numbers +400 +200 To add and subtract even larger integers, we can imagine even larger lifts! In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards and forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even have to be any building or mine around — just an ‘infinite lift’! +100 We can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like. +300 0 – 100 – 200 – 300 – 400 – 500 – 600 – 700 – 800 – 900 For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000 – (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground and 200 below the ground. Recall that, Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed To go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we must press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after that to get to + 2200). Therefore, (+ 2000) – (– 200) = + 2200. Notice that (+ 2000) + (+ 200) is also + 2200. Try evaluating the following expressions by similarly drawing or imagining a suitable lift: a. – 125 + (– 30) c. + 105 + (+ 55) e. + 80 + (+ 150) g. – 99 + (+ 200) b. + 105 – (– 55) d. + 80 – (– 150) f. – 99 – (– 200) h. + 1500 – (– 1500) – 1000 251 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 251 13-08-2024 17:32:08 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 In the above example, we saw that + 2000 – (– 200) = + 2000 + (+ 200) = + 2200. In other words, subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the corresponding positive number. That is, we can replace subtraction of a negative number by addition of a positive number! In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding the corresponding positive number? Math Talk Take a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you of a number line? In what ways? Back to the number line The ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line, didn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line, answering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the chapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, … Usually we drop the ‘+’ sign on positive numbers and simply write them as 1, 2, 3, … – 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Instead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can simply imagine walking on it. To the right is the positive (forward) direction, and to the left is the negative (backward) direction. Smaller numbers are now to the left of bigger numbers and bigger numbers are to the right of smaller numbers. So, 2 < 5; – 3 < 2; and – 5 < – 3. If, from 5 you wish to go over to 9, how far must you travel along the number line? 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 252 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 252 13-08-2024 17:32:09 The Other Side of Zero You must travel 4 steps. That is why 5 + 4 = 9. (Remember: Starting Number + Movement = Target Number) The corresponding subtraction statement is 9 – 5 = 4. (Remember: Target Number – Starting Number = Movement needed) Now, from 9, if you wish to go to 3, how much must you travel along the number line? 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 You must move 6 steps backward, i.e., you must move –6. Hence, we write 9 + (–6) = 3. (Remember again : S  tarting Number + Movement = Target Number) The corresponding subtraction statement is 3 – 9 = – 6. (Remember again: T  arget Number – Starting Number = Movement needed) Now, from 3, if you wish to go to – 2, how far must you travel? – 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 You must travel – 5 steps, i.e., 5 steps backward. Thus, 3 + (– 5) = – 2. The corresponding subtraction statement is: – 2 – 3 = – 5. Figure it Out – 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1. Mark 3 positive numbers and 3 negative numbers on the number line above. 2. Write down the above 3 marked negative numbers in the following boxes: 253 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 253 13-08-2024 17:32:09 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 3. Is 2 > – 3? Why? Is – 2 < 3? Why? 4. What are a. – 5 + 0 b. 7 + (– 7) c. – 10 + 20 f. – 8 – (– 10)? d. 10 – 20 e. 7 – (– 7) Using the unmarked number line to add and subtract Just as you can do additions, subtractions and comparisons with small numbers using the number line above, you can also do them with large numbers by imagining an ‘infinite number line’ or drawing an ‘unmarked number line’ as follows: 0 This line shows only the position of zero. Other numbers are not marked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to add and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale of the number line and the positions of numbers on it. For example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the addition problem: 85 + (– 60) = ? – 60 0 +25 +85 We then can visualise that 85 + (– 60) = 25 The following UNL shows a subtraction problem which can also be written as a missing addend problem: (– 100) – (+ 250) = ? or 250 + ? = – 100. ? – 100 0 + 250 We can then visualise that ? = –350 in this problem. In this way, you can carry out addition and subtraction problems, with positive and negative numbers, on paper or in your head using an unmarked number line. 254 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 254 13-08-2024 17:32:09 The Other Side of Zero Use unmarked number lines to evaluate these expressions: a. – 125 + (– 30) = _______ –5 b. + 105 – (– 55) = _______ c. + 80 – (– 150) = _______ d. – 99 – (– 200) = _______ –3 0 2 Converting subtraction to addition and addition to subtraction Recall that Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed or Target Floor = Starting Floor + Movement needed If we start at 2 and wish to go to – 3, what is the movement needed? First method: Looking at the number line, we see we need to move – 5 (i.e., 5 in the backward direction). Therefore, – 3 – 2 = – 5. The movement needed is –5. Second method: Break the journey from 2 to –3 into two parts. a. From 2 to 0, the movement is 0 – 2 = – 2. b. From 0 to –3, the movement is – 3 – 0 = – 3. The total movement is the sum of the two movements: – 3 + (– 2) = – 5. Look at the two coloured expressions. There is no subtraction in the second one! In this way, we can always convert subtraction to addition. The number that is being subtracted can be replaced by its inverse and then added instead. Similarly, a number that is being added can be replaced by its inverse and then subtracted. In this way, we can also always convert addition to subtraction. Examples: a. (+ 7) – (+ 5) = (+ 7) + (– 5) b. (– 3) – (+ 8) = (– 3) + (– 8) c. (+ 8) – (– 2) = (+ 8) + (+ 2) d. (+ 6) – (– 9) = (+ 6) + (+ 9) 255 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 255 13-08-2024 17:32:09 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 10.2 The Token Model Using tokens for addition In Bela’s Building of Fun, the lift attendant is bored. To entertain himself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative (black) tokens. Each time he presses the ‘+’ button, he takes a positive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly, each time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and puts it in his pocket. He starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative tokens. On which floor is he now? He must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2. So, he is at Floor + 2 now. Here is another way to do the calculation. A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively, and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2. We can perform any such addition using tokens! Example: Add + 5 and – 8. 256 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 256 13-08-2024 17:32:15 The Other Side of Zero From the picture, we see that we can remove five zero pairs, and we are then left with – 3. Therefore (+ 5) + (– 8) = – 3. Figure it Out 1. Complete the additions using tokens. a. (+ 6) + (+ 4) b. (– 3) + (– 2) c. (+ 5) + (– 7) d. (– 2) + (+ 6) 2.	Cancel the zero pairs in the following two sets of tokens. On what floor is the lift attendant in each case? What is the corresponding addition statement in each case? a. b. Using tokens for subtraction We have seen how to perform addition of integers with positive tokens and negative tokens. We can also perform subtraction using tokens! Example: Let us subtract: (+5) – (+4). This is easy to do. From 5 positives take away 4 positives to see the result. (+ 5) – (+ 4) = + 1 Example: Let us subtract: (–7) – (–5). Is (– 7) – (– 5) the same as (– 7) + (+ 5)? (–7) – (–5) = –2 Example: Let us subtract: (+ 5) – (+ 6). Put down 5 positives. But there are not enough tokens to take out 6 positives! 257 Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 257 13-08-2024 17:32:24 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 To get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a positive and a negative), knowing that this does not change the value of the set of tokens. Now, we can take out 6 positives! See what is left: We conclude that (+5) – (+6) = – 1. Figure it Out 1. Evaluate the following differences using tokens. Check that you get the same result as with other methods you now know: a. (+ 10) – (+ 7) b. (– 8) – (– 4) c. (– 9) – (– 4) d. (+ 9) – (+ 12) e. (– 5) – (– 7) 2. Complete the subtractions: a. (– 5) – (– 7) b. (+ 10) – (+ 13) d. (+ 3) – (+ 8) e. (– 2) – (– 7) f. (– 2) – (– 6) c. (– 7) – (– 9) f. (+ 3) – (+ 15) Example: + 4 – (– 6). Start with 4 positives. We have to take out 6 negatives from these. But there are not enough negatives. This is not a problem. We add some zero pairs as this does not change the value of the set of tokens. But how many zero pairs? We have to take away 6 negatives so we put down 6 zero pairs:
