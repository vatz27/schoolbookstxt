CHAPTER The Value of Work 13 When you are doing any work, do not think of anything beyond. Do it as worship, as the highest worship, and devote your whole life to it for the time being. — Swami Vivekananda The Big Questions 1. 2. What are the different types of activities that people engage in? What is their contribution to our everyday lives? Anu and Kabir were playing in the park when they saw their neighbour, Geeta Aunty, getting out of a taxi. She was returning home from work and was in her uniform. A pilot in the Indian Air Force, she is the pride of the whole town. That uniform on the hanger belongs to my grandfather. He retired from the Border Security Force and now spends his time ... 13 ― The Value of Work Kabir, Aunty’s uniform looks a lot like the one I saw at your house yesterday, but the colour is different. 183 13_100724_v8_.indd 183 11-Jul-24 4:29:51 PM ... tending to our vegetable garden, and ... ... running errands for the home. My parents run a shop that sells uniforms and other ready-made garments. Appa leaves early in the morning and Maa joins him in the shop after we leave for school. Maa is usually back by the time we return home from school. She also contributes to a voluntary group that teaches knitting to the women in the community. Do you remember my elder brother Rohan? You met him when he came to pick me up from school. He is a software engineer and works in a company that makes computer applications. On the weekends he volunteers to teach computer skills to those who have joined the youth development programme of the nearby college.

Mention them in the table given below: Character in the story Activities they are engaged in Economic activities are those that involve money or are performed in exchange for money or money’s worth for the parties involved. For example, a business person selling school bags in the market, a farmer selling produce in the market, a lawyer arguing a case and earning a fee, a truck driver transporting goods from one place to another, workers employed in a car manufacturing factory, etc. Market: A place where people engage in the exchange of goods and services. People may exchange goods and services for other goods but in most markets these are exchanged for money. 13_100724_v8_.indd 185 Fee: A payment made to a person or organisation in exchange for professional advice or services. For example, a fee paid to a doctor and a lawyer. Money’s worth: The monetary value that a person places on an object based on the benefit that they derive from it. 13 ― The Value of Work Different types of activities, like the ones discussed above, are divided into two groups or categories: economic activities and non-economic activities. 185 11-Jul-24 4:29:56 PM Non-economic activities are those that do not generate income or wealth but are done out of feelings like gratitude, Left to right, top to bottom: A business person selling school bags in the market Farmers selling their harvest in the market A lawyer arguing a case A truck driver transporting goods from one place to another Workers employed in a car manufacturing factory Exploring Society: India and Beyond Economic Life Around Us love, care and respect. For instance, parents cooking food for the family or helping their children with schoolwork, youth taking care of the grandparents, family members helping in the renovation of the house, etc. Left to right: Parents cooking food for the family Mother helping her children with schoolwork 186 13_100724_v8_.indd 186 11-Jul-24 4:29:58 PM Left to right: Youth taking care of the grandparents Family members helping in the renovation of the house LET’S EXPLORE In the table given on page 185, did you notice the third empty column? Label this column ‘economic / non-economic activity’. Now classify them according to the nature of activity. In Anu’s and Kabir’s story, Geeta Aunty, the Air Force pilot, receives a salary. She serves the country and performs an economic activity too. Anu’s brother, Rohan, works for a software company and is given a salary for it. Over the weekend, he also volunteers at the youth development programme of the nearby college, where he teaches computer skills to young adults. This is a non-economic activity. Salary: A fixed regular payment generally paid monthly by an employer to an employee.  When Kabir’s grandfather voluntarily teaches the neighbourhood kids for free, is that an economic activity or a non-economic activity? How is it different from your teachers teaching you at school? Discuss with your classmates.  What are some non-economic activities that are important to you and your family? Why are they valuable? 13 ― The Value of Work THINK ABOUT IT 187 13_100724_v8_.indd 187 11-Jul-24 4:29:59 PM Types of Economic Activities Exploring Society: India and Beyond Economic Life Around Us Kavya was excited to go to her aunt’s house in the village of Kamlapur. On the way, she saw that a highway was being built near the village, and the construction site was abuzz with activity. Large machines, such as excavators and bulldozers, were being operated by dedicated technicians. 188 13_100724_v8_.indd 188 This new highway promised to reduce the travel time to the nearest town from five hours to just two hours. Kavya thought that she would be able to visit her aunt more often once the highway was ready, since it would take less time to travel there. Happy with this thought, Kavya ran to greet her aunt and to eat the delicious jalebis that she had made. They were joined by Kavya’s uncle, who had just returned home from work. He is a technician in a construction company and operates a bulldozer. He receives a monthly salary for his services. The next day, Kavya’s aunt woke up early to finish her share of the household chores and left for work. She is 11-Jul-24 4:30:00 PM employed at the village post office and is paid a monthly salary. In the evening, after her office work, she also conducts online classes to help students prepare for school exams. She charges a weekly fee for these classes. On the weekend, Kavya visited a local mango orchard with her aunt to have some delicious mangoes. THINK ABOUT IT On your way from home to school today, can you recall the various economic activities that people are engaged in? In what ways do you think those people are paid? As we now understand, economic activities are those that have value in terms of money. Economic activities also add value at each stage of the process of transforming something into another form. This is called value addition. 13_100724_v8_.indd 189 Wage: A payment made by the employer to the worker for a specific period of time. Payment in kind: A non-cash payment that is received for the work performed. 13 ― The Value of Work There she saw Sahil, a farm labourer who was using a tractor to till a farmer’s land nearby. He earns a daily wage for his efforts. He gets some payment for his work in cash, and the remaining part of the payment in the form of mangoes of equal value. The mangoes that he receives as a part of his work are called payment in kind. 189 11-Jul-24 4:30:01 PM Let us take the example of Kavya’s father, Rajesh, to understand this. Rajesh is a carpenter who buys wood from a nearby market for ₹600 to make furniture. He uses special tools and other materials for building the furniture. Exploring Society: India and Beyond Economic Life Around Us Rajesh sells a chair for ₹1,000 each in the market. 190 13_100724_v8_.indd 190 The wood for the chair costs ₹600. So, what is the remaining ₹400 (₹1,000 – ₹600) for? It is the monetary value of Rajesh’s skill, time and effort, which went into making that chair. Rajesh has added value to the wood by turning it into furniture. From buying the wood to selling the chair, these activities involve payment. They are, therefore, a part of economic activities. 11-Jul-24 4:30:02 PM LET’S EXPLORE Put a  against those activities/professions that you think create monetary value. Can you add two activities and examples of money related value creation to the empty rows at the end? Activity / Profession Example of money-related value creation 1. Baker 2. Tailor 3. Farmers repairing their tractor 4. Doctor 5. Parents cooking dinner for their family 6. Scientist 7. Person taking care of a sick grandparent 8. 9. While non-economic activities may not involve money, the value they generate is important in our lives. Sevā: selfless service We see sevā in many places such as temples, gurudwaras, mosques and churches. For instance, langars or community kitchens at gurudwaras serve food to every visitor for free. These practices foster a sense of satisfaction and gratitude 13_100724_v8_.indd 191 13 ― The Value of Work The Importance of Non-Economic Activities 191 11-Jul-24 4:30:02 PM for what we have, and they are also a way of contributing to society without expecting anything in return. Temple distributing prasād to devotees Langar at the Golden Temple The strength of community participation Exploring Society: India and Beyond Economic Life Around Us Swachh Bharat Abhiyan 192 13_100724_v8_.indd 192 The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is based on the collective efforts of all Indian citizens to keep our surroundings clean. Individually, we keep our homes and surroundings clean. People have also come together to clean up streets, roads, parks and other public places or community areas. Together, these efforts lead to a clean home, neighbourhood, society and nation. Another example of collective community participation is the celebration of Van Mahotsav (the festival of forests) in India to promote awareness about the value of trees and the conservation Van Mahotsav 11-Jul-24 4:30:04 PM of forests. The initiative brings together members of the community for tree plantation drives. THINK ABOUT IT  Many communities in India have similar practices that involve community participation. Can you identify a few from your area?  We celebrate many festivals in India. During these festivals, people gather to organise all the various activities. They decorate the place together and share the food that they cook. Are these non-economic activities? Why do you think they still hold value?  Can you identify community programmes that have been undertaken by your school or in your locality? What did you observe during these programmes? Before we move on... Æ In this chapter, we learnt about economic and noneconomic activities. Æ We also learnt about the value addition that economic activities create. Æ We understood how non-economic activities contribute to social welfare, personal wellbeing and enhance the overall quality of life. 1. How are economic activities different from non-economic activities? 2. What kind of economic activities do people engage in? Illustrate with examples. 3. There is great value attached to people who are engaged in community service activities. Comment on this statement. 4. What are the various ways in which people are compensated for various economic activities? Give some examples. 13_100724_v8_.indd 193 13 ― The Value of Work Questions, activities and projects 193 11-Jul-24 4:30:05 PM Exploring Society: India and Beyond Economic Life Around Us Noodles 194 13_100724_v8_.indd 194 *‘Noodles’ is our abbreviation for ‘Notes and Doodles’! 11-Jul-24 4:30:05 PM
