After some time, Madam Vidya, their science teacher, enters the class and starts interacting with the students to draw their attention to many things they use in their daily life. She asks, "How are they similar to or different from each other? What are their shapes and colours? How does it feel when you touch them? Are some of them heavier than others?" All things are made up of some materials like paper, wood, cloth, glass, metal, plastic, clay, and so on. Any substance that is used to create an object is referred to as material. Activity 6.1: Let us identify Make a list of objects you see around and also write the names of the materials they are made up of in Table 6.1. Table 6.1: Identify materials I observe Do you know? Let us explore materials further. 6.2 How to Group Materials? Activity 6.2: Let us group ?

You must h iced that an object can be made from differen Vls andsome materials can be used to make more th   e object. The me od of arranging the objects into groups is called classification. Objects can be classified on the basis of a common property that they have. Similarly, we can classify materials based on certain properties.

Observe Fig. 6.4 and group the objects in as many different ways as possible. You might have grouped these objects according to their shapes or by their colour or materials they are made up of. We have learnt that materials may be classified on the basis of their properties.

Collect small pieces of paper, cardboard, wood, chalk, copper wire, aluminium foil and any article made up of brass, bronze, steel, etc. Take a look at the pieces you have collected. Do any of these materials shine when light falls on them? Observe their texture (whether rough or smooth), colour and other noticeable features, and record your observations in the notebook. Group the collected pieces based on their appearance. Materials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to have a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous		Are all lustrous materials are those that do not have a shiny	materials metals? surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc. "All that glitters is not gold" goes an old saying! Not all the materials that shine r	metals.

Do you think it would be possible for Sheeta's brother to see her and her friends through a closed wooden window of the house? There are many materials through which you are not able to see at all. These materials are called opaque. Wood, cardboard and metals are examples of opaque materials. The materials through which objects can be seen, but not clearly, are known as translucent. Butter paper and frosted glass are examples of translucent materials. Look at Fig. 6.5. Identify and label the nature of materials used by Ghulan (A), Sheeta (B), Sara (C) and Sheeta's brother (D).

(a) Half-filled	(b) Fully-filled Fig. 6.8: Glass tumblers with varying levels of water� Why is the level of water different in the two tumblers? Madam Vidya elaborates that both tumblers have the same capacity. The water levels differ in each case, which indicates that the amount of water in each tumbler is different. The water in the first tumbler occupies less space, indicating that the volume of water in this tumbler is less than the water in the other tumbler. The space occupied by water represents its volume.

Are there any properties which can be shown by all � Is air matter? Can all the materials around us be considered	as	different	examples	of )	matter? Discuss with your friends. For example, water is matter, sand and pebbles are matter and so is the cup. Materials are types of matter used in the creation or making of objects. We learnt that materials look different and behave differently. We grouped materials on the basis of similarities or differences in their properties. We find grouping useful as it helps us stu and observe patterns in the properties of things. Huma 1:i e been classifying not only things, but also rock		nd animals.
