Reshma lives in a coastal town of Kerala and is very fond of writing short stories. Her grandmother loves listening to her stories, so Reshma was writing a new story to share with her grandmot on her 60th bi   day. The storywas based on a ship carrying spices from Kerala for trade in the olden days. Resh was aware that in those the sailors used stars directions at night. But i	er story, a situation aeherein the sailors got cau	�	a star with an overcast sl<	and t were not visible. Reshma	ul	not take her story forward as she could not think a w	for sailors to find directions. She searched for � fa mation on the internet and her school library. She	that the travellers used a device, Iyw a magnetic compass, for finding ect10ns. Fi  �	Reshma had seen pencil boxes and purses which had magnets to keep them closed. A writing board in her school also had a duster with a magnet. But she had never looked at those carefully. She now became curious to learn more about magnets and magnetic compasses. Fig. 4.1: Some common items that have magnets attached to them The magnets used by sailors in the olden days were based on naturally occurring magnets, known as lodestones which were discovered in ancient times. Later on, people found out that magnets could also be made from pieces of iron. Nowadays, we have magnets made of different mat rials. The magnets that you find in your school laborato  nd those used in pencil boxes, stickers, toys are all	al magnets (Fig. 4.1). The magnets can be of vario some of which are shown in Fig. 4.2. � Bar	U-shaped	"4ge; magnet	et	ma � G-j gnets ...

Predict which of the objects will stick to the magnet. Write your prediction in Table 4.1. ? Now hold a magnet in your hand and bring it near the objects one by one (Fig. 4.3). Observe which of the � objects stick to the magnet. I C Fig. 4.3: Identifying the materials attracted by a magnet	0 ? Record your observations in Table 4.1.

What conclusion can you draw? Through this activity, we found out that some of the objects were attracted to the magnet and stuck to it, while others were not. The materials which are attracted towards a magnet are called magnetic materials. The  metal iron is a  magnetic	material. Do all parts of a magnet attract magnetic materials equally? Nickel and cobalt are other metals that are also magnetic. Some of their combinations with	other	metals	are	also	attracted towards magnets.

Most of the iron filings stick to the poles of a magnet of any shape. It is not possible to obtain a magnet with a single pole. If a magnet is broken into smaller pieces, North and South poles always Can we find a magnet with a single pole? exist in pairs even in the smallest piece of the A single North pole or a South pole cannot exist. 4.3 Finding Directions magnet. I L Fig. 4.5: A freely suspended bar magnet A freely suspended magnet comes to rest along the north-south direction. The end of the magnet that points towards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or the North pole of the magnet. The other end that points towards the South direction is called the South-seeking pole or the South pole of the magnet. A freely suspended magnet rests along the north-south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of the bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along any direction. This implies that only magnets rest ng north-south direction. This activity provides us with y to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or nof'>: The property of a freely suspended magn	s rest along the north-south dir on is used to			rections.

Collect a few materials like a cork piece, iron sewing needle, a permanent bar magnet, a glass bowl, and water. ? Place the iron sewing needle on a wooden table. Then keep any one pole of the magnet at one end of the needle. Move the magnet over the needle	d' along its length as shown in Fig. 4.7a. When it reaches the other end of the needle, lift it up.	= -:>-:> ? Bring the same pole of the magnet you started with to the same end of the sewing needle from which you began, and repeat the previous step. Repeat this process at least 30 to 40 times. Fig. 4.7(a): Making an iron needle a magnet ? Bring some iron filings or steel pins near the needle. If the pins or iron filings get attracted to the needle, then that means that the needle has beco=me a magnet. ? Pass this needle through the cork	� ontally.

Take a pair of bar magnets on which North and South poles have been marked. Mark the two bar magnets as AandB. ? Place the longer side of magnet A over 5-6 round shaped pencils as shown in Fig. 4.8a. ? Now bring one end of magnet B near the end of magnet A placed on the pencils. Make sure that the two magnets do not touch each other. Observe what happens. ? Next, bring the other end of magnet B near the sa  e  d of magnet A (Fig. 4.8b). Does the magnet A on 1  cils begin to move? Does it always move in on of the approaching mag,t  What do th1 rvations suggest?	, "	� ,e-Q-. (u Magnet B (a)	(b) Fig. 4.8: Interaction between two bar magnets You will see that unlike poles of two magnets, that is, the North pole of one magnet and the South pole of another magnet, attract each other. The like poles, that is, either the North poles or the South poles of both magnets, repel each other. ? Repeat the activity by using an iron bar in place of one of the magnets. What do you observe this time? I	You will find that both the ends of the iron bar will be attracted by both the North and South poles of the magnet. From this activity, we find that a magnet can be identified by its property of repulsion. Activity 4.6: Let us experiment ? Take a magnetic compass and a bar magnet. ? Place the magnetic compass over a horizontal surface and wait for its needle to come to rest. ? Now slowly bring North pole of the bar magnet close to the North The compass needle is also a magnet. Will it show the same behaviour if a magnet is brought closer to it? pole of the compass needle as show	� . Fig. 4.9a. Observe the compass n	e ull. What do you observe? Does t n	efl	t	, in which direction? d0 s Fig. 4.9: A compass needle and a magnet (a) (b) When the North pole of a magnet is brought closer to the North pole of the compass needle, it moves away as shown in Fig. 4.9a. When the South pole of the magnet is brought closer to the North pole of the compass needle, it moves closer (Fig. 4.9b). Suppose we place a piece of wood between the compass needle and the magnet. Will this affect the deflection of the compass needle? Activity 4.7: Let us invest eat the first or second part of Activity4.6. Without disturbing the bar magnet and magnetic compass, place a piece of wood between them, perpendicular to the table as r'\	-		shown in Fig. Fig. 4.10: c a edle and a magnet	4.10. Observe the w	pie wood in between	compass needle carefully. Is there any effect on the deflection of compass needle due to the piece of wood? Record your observation in '	"'	Table 4.2. ? Repeat the process by replacing the piece of wood by a cardboard sheet, thin plastic sheet, and a thin glass sheet. � Table 4.2: Observing the effect of magnet through non-magnetic materials S. no.

Magnet says, "Store me properly. Keep me in pairs with unlike poles on the same side. Keep a piece of wood in between. Place two pieces of soft iron across the ends."

For constructing the toy, fix ring magnets in an alternate North-South fashion along the length of a scale using glue (Fig. 4.18a). Paint a frog on paper, cut along the outline and glue a ring magnet at its base. Take a transparent, flexible plastic strip (Fig. 4.18a) of a smaller size and glue it to the ring magnet which is attached to the frog.
