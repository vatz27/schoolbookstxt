Aavi has a counte eThirav. What do you think? Why? /?We	n put wate _	reezer 1gerator eek if it gets nverted intoice.	/ Do you think Thirav is right? How can you find out? Activity 8.1: Let us observe ? Put an ice cube in a cup, leave it on the table and observe. Ice gets converted into water. What can you conclude from the observations? Does this mean that ice and water are the same substance? Yes, ice and water are the two forms of the same substance. These forms are also called states. These different states of water show many differences in their behaviour. Water flows but ice does not. Water splashes but ice does n 8.1 Investigating Water's Disappearing ? It is a rainy morning. While going to school,  � and Thirav observe that there are a lot of wate	in the playground.

Does the reason you thought earlier to exJyiiWer disappearance apply in this case also? Aa nders if water has seeped through the surface of ensils. rav thinks that water does not seep through the e of the utensils. Design an activity to investigate "	VJ hose idea is correct. Activity 8.2: Let us investigate ? Take a tablespoon of water on a steel plate as shown in Fig. 8.1. I	?  Observe whether water seeps through to the other side of the plate or not. ? Keep observing this at regular intervals until the water completely disappears. What do you infer? Is this activity enough to come to the conclusion that water does not seep through a steel plate? If water does not seep through the steel plate. Then, where has the water gone? This water gets converted into gaseous state called water vapour. The water vapour is another state of water. Let us think of another observation where you notice the water disappearing. While making dosa, we sprinkle some water on the hot pan and it disappears. Where it go?

What happens to it? 8.2 Another Mystery Next day, Aavi, Thirav and their friends decide to make lemonade. During the preparation, they take cold water in a glass tumbler and add ice cubes into it. After a few minutes, they notice something exciting about the outer surface of the glass tumbler. Let us find out by conducting a similar activity ourselves. Activity 8.3: Let us experiment ?

You may be curious about where the water droplets come from. Suggest possible reasons explaining the appearance of water droplets on the outer surface of the glass tumbler. Discuss with your friends.

What do you observe? Water level in the glass tumbler does not go down but the extra water gets collected on the outer surface of the glass tumbler. What can you conclude from this? This activity shows that water is not seeping from the glass tumbler and the extra water is getting collected because of condensation. 8.3 What are the Different States of Water? Water is a substance that can be observed in three different states in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On heating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. On further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous state. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties of different states of water. Activity 8.5: Let us identify ?

Shape Ability to flow	I Ability to spread What are the differences in the properties of water in solid, liquid and gaseous states? Ice (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the container in which it is placed while water takes the shape of the container. Ice does not flow or spread. Water (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water does not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the container in which it is kept, but the volume of water remains constant. Does water also possess the property to spread? Yes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the volume constant.

Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG) machines collect water from humid air to produce drinkable water. This is done through condensation of water vapour by cooling the air. This process is similar to the formation of drops of water outside the glass tumbler filled with ice More to	cold water. know! How can you quickly change	I ice to its liquid state, water? Ifwe have to change ice into water, and water into water vapour, we have to supply heat to it. If we want to change water into ice, what should be done? It can be done by placing water in a cold environment, such as a freezer. Water freezes and is converted into ice. If we take the ice out of r, it melts and is converted into water.

In section 8.1, we have learnt about evaporation. Let us explore it more! Observe your surroundings. What are the conditions that affect how fast water evaporates? What differences do you see in evaporation on a cold day versus a hot day? Discuss with your friends. The following words may help in your discussion-fan, drying cloth, sweating, windy day, hot day, rainy day.

Place one of the cap in sunlight and keep the other in shade as shown in Fig. 8.6. ? Observe the two caps of bottles after every 15 minutes. ?

It is once again a common observation that clothes dry faster on a windy day. With the increase in the movement of air, water evaporates faster. Do you more on rainy days and hence rainy days are more humid. ? It is also a common observation that clothes dry slowly on a rainy day. On a rainy day, water evaporates slowly. If the amount of water in the air is already high (more humidity), water evaporates slowly. If you want to dry your clothes on a know? 8.6 Cooling Effect rainy day, how can you make it faster?
