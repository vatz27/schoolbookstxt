, ,	Wrong measurements are worse than no measurements at all. -Anna Mani � We know from experience that some bodies are hotter than others. For example, during summers, the tap water may be hotter than the cold water from a matka (earthen pot) or a refrigerator. We can realise this by merely touching the two samples of water. But can we always rely upon our sense of touch? Let us find out. Activity 7.1: Let us investigate ? Take three large containers and label them A, B and	C, as shown in Fig. 7.1. ? Pour warm water in container A, tap water in B and ice� cold water in C. ? We will conduct this activity in two parts -	preo�ction and observation. ?

Now, conduct the activity and write your observations. Compare whether your observations match with your predictions. Did your right hand feel that the water in container B is cool, while your left hand felt that the same water is warm? What do you infer I	from these observations? en how do We cannot always rely upon our sense of touch to decide correctly whether a body is hot or cold. 7.2 Temperature d out how r cold a bo A reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature than a colder body. The difference in temperature between the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison another body. A device that measures t erature is ca$   ,. a thermometer.	� There are two kinds of thermomafh  yo a to come across-clinical ther	rs and	ory thermometers.

For measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers generally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this scale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is denoted by 0C. Earlier, mercury thermometers were used for measuring the body temperature. But mercury is an extremely toxic substance and is difficult to dispose of if the thermometer breaks accidently.

It consists of a long, narrow, uniform glass tube which is sealed. At one end of the tube is a bulb which contains a liquid. Outside the bulb, in the tube, a narrow column of liquid can be seen. There is a Celsius scale marked along the tube. The liquid column rises or falls with change in temperature. The mark of the Celsius scale with which the top level of the liquid column coincides is the temperature reading.

Generally, as we approach the summer season, the temperature rises and during the winter season it falls. There are many techniques for measuring air temperature.
