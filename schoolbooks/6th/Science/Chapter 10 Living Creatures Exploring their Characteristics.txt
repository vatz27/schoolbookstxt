Her mother advise er not to do so and explains that the shell could be		living snail and is actually a part of its body. A	Aayush wonder how the shell that is not even m in could have a living being inside! Later that day in sch' ol, Avadhi and Aayush share this incident with their friends. They approach the teacher to understand how a shell which is not even moving could be a body part of a living snail. The teacher initiates a discussion in the class on living and non-living. Activity 10.1: Let us record We are surrounded by numerous things. Just look around in your classroom and you may find many examples-the pencil that you are holding, the book that you are reading or the pigeon near the window. ?

L	t Table 10.1. Why do you think a pencil is non-living a pigeon is living? What do you think are the differences ween living beings and non-living things according to "  "'you? What similarities do the identified living beings share with each other? You may have identified movement as one of the similarities among living beings. You have also seen cars moving on a road. Does it mean that a car is living? List the I	tasks that you can do but a car cannot. You are a wonderful example of a living being. Whenever you attempt to group things around you as living or non-living, you can compare them with yourself. Which characteristics help you in differentiating yourself from a car? For instance, a car does not grow. Does it mean it is non-living? Now, which characteristics have you used to classify a car as non-living? Continue your discussion in a similar way to identify the essential characteristics of living beings. What are some common characteristics that make living beings very different from the non-living things? Let us learn about them. Can we consider movement as one of the characteristics to differentiate between the living and the non-living? List five things around you that can move on their own. Do you thi-..-..r----. that all five things that you have listed ca	e considere living just because they can move on th own? However, unlike animals, pla	o not move from one place to an e.	o you consider them as living? Even though plants do normo	om one place to another, the		ertai types of movements.

Can you	Growth of a child wear the dress that you used to wear four years ago? No, because you have become larger in size. This is due to growth in your body. Plants and other living beings also grow. Can we consider growth as a characteristic of living beings? Living beings need food (nutrition) for their growth and development. List five living beings that require food to grow. Now, think of a process without which we cannot live. Count the number of breaths you take per minute after a normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. Record the data and observe. Do you notice any difference in the number of breaths after each situation? Do yo tice the process of breathing in other animals like do  c s, cows and buffaloes?

H	u noticed w	patches forming on shirts around armpits	during	summers?	These es are formed due to sweat. The weat consists of water and salts removed by the body as waste products. Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion. Urine is also formed as a product of excretion in animals. Do you know that plants also excrete? You may notice plants excrete excess water and minerals in the form of small droplets on leaves. For example, grasses and roses. All living beings excrete. Let us look at another characteristic. What is your reaction if you unexpectedly Water droplets on grass step on a sharp object, such as a thorn, while walking without shoes, or you accidentally touch a hot cup of tea? Stepping on a thorn and touching a hot object are stimuli. Any thing or any event that prompts living beings to respond is called a stimulus. List three stimuli (plural of stimulus) and your body's instant response to them. Do plants also respond to stimuli? Yes, plants also respond to stimuli. For example, touch� me-not (mimosa, chhui-mui, lajjalu) plants fold their leaves when we touch them. Have you also observed that certain plants fold their leaves after sunset? Specifically, the leaves of certain plants facing each other tend to come together. This can be observed in the sleeping leaves  -me- ot '-   ui) plant of  amla  (Indian  gooseberry)6't	'- tree.

All living bei g.5roduce. Reproduction is the process of produc	ones of one's own kind. Why is reproductionessary? It is necessary for the continuity of life. Whe r�  being is not able to exhibit all of the above mentio	aracteristics, despite the availability of all resources  ike food, air and water) needed for being alive, it is said to be dead. From the above discussion, we can understand that all living beings share some common characteristics. For example, all living beings show movement, they need food, and they grow. They also respire, reproduce, excrete, respond to stimuli, and eventually, die. Absence of any of these features indicates that they are non-living things. Now that you know how to identify a living being, fill up the remaining two columns (IV and V) of Table 10.1 and complete the activity. In which category would you place a seed-living or non� living? Why? Let us explore how a seed germinates to observe some of these essential characteristics in plants. 10.2 Essential Conditions for GerminationX. of a Seed	V Have you observed a seed germinating?

They use the tffl\lfailable in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, ces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily. "		Light and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for the bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their germination. In general, most seeds do not require light for germination. But after germination, sunlight is required for further growth of the seedling. Do you know? Some seeds of flowering plants, like Coleus and Petunia, require light to germinate. Covering these seeds with soil inhibits their sprouting. Seeds of flowering plants, like Calendula and Zinnia, need darkness to germinate. These seeds should be covered with sufficient soil. In the Chapter 'Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body', you have learnt that human beings need a balanced diet for good health and proper growth. Similarly, plants too need favourable conditions and nutrients for their proper growth and development.	_r> What other conditions do you think would	How wo ld affect seed germination?	now cat	r	a In	Activity		10.1,	what	are			see ,	or characteristics	of	living	beings ch		n		� made you place plants in living b �?.

Also, the shoot bends and grows upwards. 3. When the plant gets sunlight only from one direction, the shoot grows in the direction of light while the root continues to grow downwards. After conducting Activity 10.3, we can conclude that shoots of plants grow upward and exhibit movement towards sunlight but roots of plants grow downwords. , Know a scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose (1858-1937) was an Indian scientist who did some fascinating experiments with plants.

You " "'might have learnt from newspapers, school noticeboards or awareness campaigns that mosquito breeding should be prevented. We are advised not to allow water to stagnate anywhere in our surroundings. Why is it so? Does stagnant water have any relation with mosquitoes laying eggs? Conduct a safety audit in your school, or at your home and surroundings to check for stagnant water (if available, carry a hand lens to observe any small creatures). Some common places where stagnant water is likely to gather are desert coolers, planted pots and any open container. You may find two different types of worm-like creatures (Fig. 10.5). They are larva and pupa, two distinct life stages during the development of mosquito. In case you observe larvae and pupae, report to your teacher. Discuss with the teacher and classmates about the necessary measures one can take to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. What differences do you observe in the shape of larvae and pupae?

This layer separates water from air, and does not allow larvae and pupae to inhale air. As a result, they die. Activity 10.5: Let us analyse Let us solve an interesting puzzle. How will you decide which stage (larva or pupa) comes immediately after the egg stage? Suppose you are given a container with water from a puddle containing larvae and pupae. Design an activity to find out the correct sequence of these stages. You can take help of the following activity designed by Avadhi to create your own activityStep 1:	I have a water container with mosquito larvae and pupae. Step 2:	I will separate  4-5 larvae  and pupae in	o separate containers with the same watert,	? Step 3:	I will observe them every day un i	I them changing to the n x stage.

St o" Fig. 10.6: Life cycle of a mosquito I		Let us learn more about these stages in the life cycle of a mosquito. Mosquitoes pass through four stages in their life cycle� egg, larva, pupa and adult (Fig. 10.6). The adult mosquito that emerges from the pupa rests briefly on the surface of water and then flies away. The adult mosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days. We have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg (stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage II), the larva grows into pupa (stage III), and the pupa transforms into an adult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays eggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues. Significant changes occur in the appearance, body shape and structure during the various stages in the life cycle of a mosquito. The shape of the egg is quite different from t	"CJ larva; the larva appears very different the pupa. pi. .. pupa appears very distinct from the	mosqui easy to imagine that a mosquito em	a pu The silk moth also passes thro	fe sta e	lar....._v-a,	, pupa and adult.

After a brief walk led by their science teacher, they reach a shallow pond. It is surrounded by trees and tall grasses. The teacher cautions them to watch everything from a distance without causing any disturbance. You may also go to a small water body during the rainy season with a facilitator and explore it by taking due safety precautions. You may notice a white jelly-like substance on the surface of water towards the edge of the pond (Fig. 10.7). This may also be attached to plants growing in or around the water. This jelly-like substance is actually a cluster of eggs of a frog and is known as spawn. Observe the features of all the stages of a frog shown in Fig.10.7.How will you decide the sequence of thegiven stages (A, B, C, D, E, F)? Some of the stages show distinct changes in their initial and final shapes. Record these changes i ble 10.5. Base the observations listed in Table 10.5, draw the life	frog.

Some of the stages have been clubbed together, for example, stages A and F in Fig. 10.7 have been kept under stage I. You will find four stages in the life cycle of a frog� the egg stage, which progresses to the embryo stage; the tadpole stage, consisting of an early stage with a tail and no legs, and a late stage with hind legs; the froglet stage, and the adult frog stage (Fig. 10.8).
