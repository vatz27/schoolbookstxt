It is a pleasant morning after yesterday's refreshing rain. Dr Raghu and Maniram chacha (uncle) have been invited to the school by the science teacher, Madam Sulekha, to facilitate an exciting nature walk. Dr Raghu is a scientist at the nearby Research Laboratory and Maniram chacha is an elderly person from a nearby community. Maniram chacha is an expert in mimicking bird calls. He is also brilliant at identifying a variety of plants and animals. To prepare them for the nature walk, Dr Raghu informs the students that the objective of this walk is to experience the beauty and variety of plants and animals in the nature. The students are excited to join them. They are curious to interact and learn from them. The teacher advises the students to carry a notebook, a pen and a water bottle. As they walk, they begin exploring the plants and - als around them. Dr Raghu advises the students to no � e e variety of smells in the park and emphasises resr,t  all living creatures and observing them with bing. Maniram chacha tells the st d  ts to not only o		different plants and animals but al  to carefu  �	o different sounds. The students	a var�	ts, including Wow!

Sketch the plants and animals observed by you in your notebook or prepare a scrapbook with leaves, flowers from different plants and feathers from animals. Write all the details you have gathered about them. While travelling to and from school, observe your surroundings and look out for a variety of plants and animals. Add the name of any plant or animal that you have not listed before in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. Activity 2.2: Let us appreciate ? Close your eyes for 30 seconds and think of one plant and one animal that you have closely observed and have appreciated very much. ? Now each one of you can draw the plant and animal that you thought of on the blackboard. ? What are your observations about the various plants and animals that have been drawn? ?

For example, some students may have chosen the height of plants as the basis for grouping while others might have chosen presence or absence of flowers as the basis for grouping of plants (See Fig. 2.2). Fig. 2.2: Some possible criteria of groupings of plants and animals You may have grouped animals based on varied features, such as what they eat, where they live, what colour they are and how they move. What is the importance of grouping? Grouping makes it easier to understand and study plants and animals on the basis of their similarities and differences. You will learn more about the importance of grouping in our daily lives in the chapter, 'Materials Around Us'. 2.2.1 How to group plants?

(b)Shrub	(c) Herb Fig. 2.3: Types of plants Some plants are not as tall as trees. These plants often have many brown woody stems that start branching very close to the ground. These stems are hard but not as thick as the stem of a tree. These plants are called shrubs. For example, a rose plant is a shrub (Fig. 2.3b). Some plants are typically small with soft and green stems. These are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a herb (Fig. 2.3c). Some plants with weak stems need support to climb and grow, and are called climbers. Some plants creep along the ground and are called creepers. What can be other features on the basis of which you can group plants? Let us perform another activity. Activity 2.5: Let us compare ?

This pattern is called re � u ate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus exhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you may observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called parallel venation. For example, the leaves of banana plants and grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c). Do you think that plants can be grouped on the basis of venation present in their leaves? Now, let us try to explore roots of the plants. Do all plants have roots? Are these roots similar? Activity 2.6: Let us find out ? Visit an open area where wild herbs and grasses are growing. You may use small herbs for this exercise. ? Using a khurpi (trowel), carefully dig out a few different herbs without damaging the roots. To do this, you may wet the soil and loosen it. ? Wash the roots with water and observe them ? After you are done observing, make sure to r	e herbs so that they may continue to thrive and    .

The main root is called taproot. Another example of a plant having taproots is hibiscus observed by you in Activity 2.1. The plant in Fig. 2.Sb is a common grass plant. The roots of this plant appear as a bunch of similar-sized thin roots arising from the base of the stem. Such roots are called fibrous roots (Fig. 2.Sb). Does your collection include any other grasses? What kind of roots do they have? Is there any relation between the type of leaf venation and the type of root of the same plant? How do we find this out? Activity 2.7: Let us relate and analyse ? Collect saplings of five common plants from your school nursery or any other nurseries to plant in your school garden. Examples of such plants can include lemongrass, marigold, sadabahar (periwinkle), and others. ? Before planting them, observe their venation in their leaves. ?

How can we group such a wide variety of animals? What features can you think of to group them? In Activity 2.3, you have already set some bases for grouping animals. Let us explore a few of these in more detail. Activity 2.9: Let us find out You have recorded the movement of a few animals in Table 2.2. You may have also observed how other animals move from place to place. Let us now think about the types of movement in animals. A number of animals are shown in Fig. 2.7. You can add more animals that you may have observed and create a poster on the variety of animals. Which body parts are used by the animals in the poster you created and those in Fig. 2.7 for movement? ? List	animals in Table 2.5. ? Note the ways in which these animals move and name the body parts used for movement. Some examples are given in Table 2.5. Table 2.5: Movements in animals and their body parts involved S. no.

Knowa ist QAmmal (1897-1984) was an Indian botanist cated to environmental work and helped document and preserve India's rich plant biodiversity. She played a key role in the 'Save Silent Valley' movement. As the head of the Botanical Survey of India, she initiated programmes to document the plant diversity of India. Success Story-Save Silent Valley Movement This is a real story of a forest in Palakkad district of Kerala. It is about preserving untouched beauty of a moist evergreen forest and its rich biodiversity. The now-famous Silent Valley was saved by a remarkable movement led by common people who were not even residing in the vicinity of the forest. The battle against the proposal of a hydroelectric dam across the Kunthipuzha river persisted for 10 years. At that time, people used all possible available means, such as widespread awareness programmes, letters to editors, articles in, newspapers, seminars, and petitions and appeals in court. The movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley. 2.3 Plants and Animals in Diff u,t	'-., Surroundings	,	"', You might have observed d1L t r	that different animals live in	surr  n�   s.

Dl11fn_Qiscussion in the classroom, r ls that he observed cactus with thick and fleshy stems in serts of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.9). Maya res that she saw deodar trees in ,   ;he Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh (Fig. 2.10). These trees are conical in shape and have flexible and sloping branches. Notice that these two types of plants found in different regions are different Fig. 2.10: A deodar tree in the mountains from each other. Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of a region vary from that of another? Let us find out. There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places. The mountains in extremely cold regions experience frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees enable them to do so easily.	r> You must have understood by now that the biodiversity   '(/ varies from region to region because of i erse condition Look at the images of a camel fro he hot deier{ " ,., Rajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel f t cold  --QI Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are th		es y; e between them? What advant	these e ences provide to these camels? Fig. 2.11: A camel livingVi,e hot	Fig. 2.12: A camel living in the desert o han		cold desert of Ladakh The c  ehot desert haslong legs with wide hooves. Alex sha s at his grandmother told him that the long legs and wide ooves help these camels to walk on the sandy desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the height and legs of camels in a cold desert are comparatively shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions. In deserts, food is not available easily. Camels store food in their humps. Camels in the hot desert have one hump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of food. Camels in the cold desert have two humps each. These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not much food available in the cold desert and they have to use food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive the cold winters of Ladakh. What other features can help camels to survive in the desert? Other students also start sharing their observ �ons. Kashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete s 11 amounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do	at.

However, Perna, from Sikkim, mentions that r., she has observed rhododendrons in the nearby mountains to be taller (Fig. 2.13b). So, even plants such as rhododendrons may exhibit different features in different regions to survive the conditions of those regions. Sagar tells his classmates that he went to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with his parents for a special event. He saw huge whales and colourful fish in the ocean. His father explained that the streamlined body (bJ Rhododendron in Sikkim	of fish makes it easier for them to Fig. 2.13: Different features of rhododendrons in two different regions swim in water. We have learnt that the plants and animals living in a particular region have special features that make them fit to survive there. The special features that enable plants and animals to survive in a particular region are called adaptations. The shape of the deodar tree and the height of the rhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive in the mountainous regions. The place where plants and animals live is called their habitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, water, air, shelter and other needs for their survival. Many types of plants and animals may share the same habitat.

One way is to group them into those hat live on land' and those 'that live in water'. The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains.	� The plants and animals that live in water are said to live in aquatic habitats. Some examples of aquatic habitats are ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans. Some animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as on land. These are called amphibians. What would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal is damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass to eat? Can a fish survive without water? Check with your parents, grandparents and neighbours to know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see as often now. These changes often happen when hs�tats are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and a 1  ls results in loss of their homes, food, and other :	es. This leads to the loss of biodiversity.
