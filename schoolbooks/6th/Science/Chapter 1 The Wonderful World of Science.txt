As human beings, we have always been curious about our surroundings. We start exploring our surroundings and asking questions right from our childhood. Did you enjoy discovering and exploring the world around you in the Preparatory Stage of school? As you enter the Middle Stage, we will continue this fascinating journey, trying to explore and understand the beautiful world we live in. And for th	"CJ we have a new subject, Science. Welcom the		" wonderful world of Science!	� Science is a way of thinking,	nd	IS doing things to understand the w	e	e i	ence? � and to uncover the secrets of h	�	er:	. Thi 1'.V of it  as a big adventure-	e as	uestio	, explore the world and r	ersta things work. For this, t	1mpor	g is to have 'Curiosity', which is whe	t e ti	'()'Ii	book comes fro hether it is s g tiny �ns of sand or massive mountains, a leaf ;s or a  forest, there is always something new and exc1�	iscover. Have you ever looked up at the night sky and wondered whyth s shine? Or watched r bloom and wo ereMtow it knows when en? These r J t a few of the ma	eries that science   lp  us unravel. The most wonderful thing about science is that it is everywhere. From the depths of the ocean to the	A mountainous region An underwater view o cea	AGalaxy scX.c)r{likea giant and unending jigsaw puzzle. Every di very we make adds another piece to that puzzle. AQ. u know the best thing about this puzzle? There is limit to what we can discover, since every new piece .N>  knowledge leads to more questions and more things to "  find out. Sometimes, we find that a piece of this puzzle has been put in the wrong place and needs to be moved. New discoveries often change our understanding of the world. As you go through this book, you will encounter interesting ideas, do some thought-provoking experiments, and see how some of what we will find out is useful in our daily lives. And guess what happens as we discover more and more? We start realising that these ideas are all connected. We will start off by looking at our home, planet Earth. It is the only planet we know that supports life, and it has an environment that we must protect. There is an amazing variety oflife on Earth-plants What will we explore with the help of this book? and animals that have managed to survive and thrive in different regions on this planet. You might have seen a seed grow into a plant, a caterpillar transform into a beautiful butterfly and many more such observations. How do these plants and animals grow? .

Across the country,  M different cuisines with their many tasty dishes.  ey made of? How do we find out? Along with food, we need water to survive. Water is such a delightful substance. Have you ever run and jumped in a puddle when it rained? Do you ever wonder why and how it rains? Have you noticed that water freezes and becomes ice when we cool it and boils and becomes steam when we heat it? Do you enjoy drinking cool water in the summer or showering with warm water in the winter? How do we understand hot and cold? Whether it is water, or our own body when we have fever, finding out how hot something is can be important! The  ag  ,  ere ale    different things around us-  p er we writ , the metal key, the plastic ruler and t	our box, the magnet that keeps the box closed	we wear, the cup we drink milk in and so	gs. What are they made of? Are they made	rials? How do we separate different We will have an almost unending list of questions about everything on Earth as we further explore this book. But why limit our questions to the Earth alone? We can ask questions on things beyond-the Sun, the Moon, and the millions of stars that shine in the sky! Whether	you	are	learning	about	the structure of a leaf, discovering how things move, or separating the skin of a peanut seed, we hope each chapter of this book will ignite your spirit of inquiry. And hopefully you will have lots of questions in your mind! How can we try to find answers to our questions	� on our own?  Even though you may not realise it, you	. have already been finding answers to many of your questions. Suppose your	pen stops writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself t'	"..C. J question, "Why did my pen stop writing ." ou might gup!'		,. that the ink finished.	� You would then test this guess&E	ing the pen and checking the ink re	1		t1s empty, you would know th		g		ss was correct.

Science is not just about memorising facts and figures or doing experiments. It is about following a step-by-step process that helps us find answers to our questions. So what are the steps that we can follow? First,	we	observe	something	that	we find	interesting or we do not understand. This makes us wonder and perhaps think of a question about it. Then, we guess a possible answer to that question. We test this guess through experiments or more observations. We then t yto analyse the results to see ifit actually ans ed ourquest10n.

When we try to ask questions and find out answers, in a way, we are all scientists! ctivity 2: Let us think and write ? Describe a daily life situation where you feel someone was following a scientific method. Do you now realise that there are several daily life situations where we knowingly or unknowingly apply the scientific method? Though we all apply the scientific method to some extent, learning science will develop our capabilities for finding solutions to bigger problems and solving more mysteries of the universe. And to be able to learn science well, the first and foremost thing is to be curious and observe your surroundings keenly. And when we are curious, we start posing questions, asking how and why? Just remember, the world is full of things we do not know, things that are waiting to be explored. Activity 3: Let us think and write ? If you have to ask "Why?" about something, what would you ask about? ? Try to write down h w you would attempt to find an answer to your quest10n.	""-. Science is rarely done alone.
