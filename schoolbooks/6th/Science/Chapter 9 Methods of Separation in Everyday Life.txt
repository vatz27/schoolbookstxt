Just like winnowing makes the husk blow away	V while retaining the grains, similarly, sages let	r> the virtues stay while discarding the vices.	""1.'.C.

Malli and Valli are fasc� te by the vari  of grains piled up in the courtyard.	Mami 9ctternal aunt) and Mama (maternal uncle), along  M    community members, are busy separating small s�s anhdusk from the grains with their hands.	.	 - Malli and Valli are curious to know why this is being done. Their Nani notices their curiosity and explains, "We are removing these stones so that the grains are fit for cooking." They go around the house to see the fields and the cattle. To keep them busy, Nani gives them a challenge of handpicking small stones from grains while keeping their eyes closed. The method of picking by hand from a mixture (when two or more substances are mixed) such as small stones and husk from wheat and rice is called handpicking. It is done on the basis of differences in size, colour and shape of the particles. If the particles to be removed are present in small quantities and can easily be picked by hand, handpicking proves to be a convenient method. At lunch,		Malli	and	Valli	are steaming	hot	vegetable	pula .		ile eating	the		pulao,		Nani				that Malli is sesating whole kk		peppers from	the	o	an	��	cing	them Fig. 9.1: Handpicking	aside on hi	g. 9.1)	ayfully teases, "Wow!

Some stalks are sprea	the sun for drying. Both of them up a stalk each and notice numerous 'VJattached to it. A group of farmers are ting the stalks on a large wooden log. Curiously, Valli asks Mama, "Why are they doing this?" Mama explains, "They are beating the stalks to separate the grains" (Fig. 9.2). This .	process of separati?g grains from the stalks Fig.	ing	1s known as threshing. Farmers work hard, yet they enjoy their work. From time to time, they sing folk songs while working. Explore folk songs of your region and try to sing along with your friends. Have fun while you learn The separated grains get mixed with piles of husk. Valli whispers to Malli, "Will the farmers handpick the grains to remove them from so much husk?" She wonders, "How much time will the farmers take to separate these?" Let us perform an activity to find out the answer to the questions raised by Valli. Activity 9.1: Let us explore A small amount of puffed rice is mixed with chana dal.

Marni: To prepare a dish with flour, first we need to remove bran that may be present in the flour. Valli: How do we do it? Mami: We use a sieve for this purpose. Sieving allows the fine flour particles to pass through the holes of the sieve as shown in Fig. 9.5. The bigger particles such as bran and small stones remain on the sieve. Carefully observe a sieve. Are all the holes of the sieve the same size? Will sieving work if the holes of the sieve are  larger than the substances? Is there any difference in the size between the particles that pass through the sieve and the particles that remain on the sieve?

In a  few  days,  the  water Fig. 9.6: Obtaining salt from seawater evaporates completely, leaving behind the solid mixture (Fig. 9.6). Common salt is then obtained from this mixture by further purification. Find out about some water bodies in India that contain common salt. One such source is Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan.	More to do! Let us explore how salt can be separated from a salt solution. Activity 9.2: Let us observe and create Have you ever observed white patches on the dark coloured clothes you wear during hot summers?

What do you think is left on the paper? You can feel the presence of salt by touching the paper. Where has the water disappeared? Recall the chapter on 'A Journey through States of Water'. Let us probe further to get the answer. In the traditional Indian system of holistic health and medicine called Ayurveda, the herbs or parts of plants are prescribed as remedies. These ingredients like roots, leaves, flowers or seeds of various medicinal plants are often dried in the shade. This practice facilitates the evaporation of excess water, leaving behind the important part of the medicine. Activity 9.3: Let us investigate This activity may be demonstrated by the teacher.

Can you name the �o	process involved? It is n me for them to visit Dada and Dadi (paternal grandpa t ...) residing in Puducherry, located in southern India. Malli and Valli are excited to meet their old neighbourhood friend, Balan. After reaching Puducherry, they start talking about the old times and do not realise that it is already evening, Dadi's tea time. Fig. 9.9: Decantation Dada: I shall prepare tea for you. Children: We will also help you. As Dada makes the tea, he shares tips on how to make a cup of tea. Balan: After preparing tea, how do you remove the tea leaves? Dada: Obviously, with a strainer. You know if we do not have a strainer, we can still remove most of the tea leaves. Valli: How? Dada:	Leave	the sauce	pan	(vessel)	containing	tea undisturbed for some time and gently pour the tea in a cup (Fig. 9.9).	X. . Valli: Oh Yes! And then the tea leaves will be settle e bottom.

BaV"t Itmeans it is not a proper method of separation. J?	es,you are right. The tea is ready now. li picks up the tea-strainer from the shelf and gives it 1sDada. '-Jnada: Let me pour the tea through this strainer. You can "	ee all the tea leaves collected in the strainer. This process of separating tea leaves from tea is called filtration. Balan asks Malli if he could use a tea strainer to filter muddy water. Let us try and find out. Dada: Also, try to filter the muddy water through a piece of cloth and observe the difference. Malli: Why should we use a piece of cloth? Dada: In a piece of cloth, there are very small holes or pores between the woven threads. These pores in the cloth can be used as a filter. People of ancient times also followed this practice. But if the water is still muddy, impurities can be separated using a filter with even smaller holes or pores. A filter paper is one such filter that has very fine pores in it. Activity 9.4: Let us experiment How many layers of cloth do I need to use to get clear water? Try to fold the filter paper yourself and make a cone as shown in Fig. 9.10. � A filter paper	Cone Fig.	ing afilt(1,'-f	o form a cone What do you observe? Do the mud particles pass through the filter paper? The water coming from the funnel will be collected in the conical flask. You will get mud as a residue on the filter paper and clear water as filtrate in the conical flask. More to know! Other than the filter paper, many materials such as cotton, charcoal, and sand can be used as filters. The choice of filter depends upon the size of the particles of the materials to be removed.

Otukkam is a fisherman. As they cast the fishing net, water drains out through the mesh. Valli recalls the filtration method she had learnt and realises that this method of catching the fish is somewhat similar. Malli is taken aback when he saw plastic bags, broken bottles, a large fish with a straw stuck in its mouth, and food wrappers along with the other fish trapped in the net. Let us raise awareness about the issues of river and ocean pollution by composing a poem.

Their stay at Maasi's place has become		enjoyable	and they are looking forward to share all their memories with their friends upon returning home. Now, it is time for them to reach their final destination of the trip, Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya.

Which method of separation did the carpenter use? Recall the chapter on 'Exploring Magnets'. The substances which are attracted towards a magnet are called magnetic substances. Iron is a common example of a magnetic substance. Separation of magnetic and non� magnetic substances by using a magnet is called magnetic separation. Nowadays, recyclers use magnets to separate iron articles from a heap of waste. In many industries, the waste material often contains scrap iron. This is separated from the heap of waste materials using magnets fitted to a crane.
