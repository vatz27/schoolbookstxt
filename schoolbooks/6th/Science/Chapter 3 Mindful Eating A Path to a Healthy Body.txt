Yo	find that some food items are common in many s w ile some are eaten only in a particular state. V V What relation dowi find between the traditional food items and the l allv grown crops? You must have observed that the trad  ood of any state is usually based on the crops gr hat state. India is an agricultural country with di s soil and climate types. Various crops are grown in ts different regions depending on the soil types and climatic conditions. In various regions of India, the choice of food may vary according to the cultivation of food crops in that particular region, taste preferences, culture, and traditions. 3.1.2 How have cooking practices changed over time? You have learnt that food habits vary across states. Our food choices as well as practices of food preparation may differ from one another. Have our food habits and cooking practices changed over time? Activity 3.3: Let us interact and find out ? Prepare a list of questions for gathering information from elderly people about their food habits and c oking practices.

Cooking practices, also called culinary practices, have changed over time. There is a significant difference between traditional and modern culinary practices. Earlier, most cooking was done using a chulha (Fig. 3.1a). Nowadays, most ofus cook using a modern gas stove (Fig. 3.1b). Earlier, most grinding was done manually using a sil-batta (Fig. 3.1c). These days, we use an electrical grinder for ease of grinding (Fig. 3.1d). Find out what were the other ways of cooking and grinding. Why have these culinary practices changed over time? These changes may be due to factors such as technological development, improved transportation and better communication. 3.2 What are the Components of Food?

We feel tired and less energetic when we do not eat for some time. Why do you think a marathon runner drinks glucose water during and after a race?

Case 2  -y In th Qndian scientists found that among the huma ulation intheHimalayan region an tftlNor-thern plains of India, symptoms of swellin front of the neck were prevalent. As pi	1	.,, '!!'ms of the Government of India, an effort was 1' ade to supplement common salt with iodine for preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised salt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling at the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre. What do you infer from Case 2? You may have learnt about iodised salt through newspapers, advertisements or by reading about it on a salt packet. What does it mean? Iodised salt is simply common salt mixed with required quantities of salts of iodine. Salt farming is a traditional practice of a tribal community named Agariyas. They practice salt		 farming in the Little Rann of Kutch and other parts of Gujarat. For eight months, they live in the extreme heat of the desert and work very hard to get salt from seawater.	ore to How	would	you	find	out	more	t	oth(  .�. components that protect our body f rnus di	-7 Activity 3.4: Let us conduct a	 ....._==	;:====================== ?

But, how can we overcome vitamin and mineral deficiency diseases or disorders? (c) Some sources ofAinC	(d) Some sources of Vitamin D Ysomesources of different vitamins Food com s   that provide energy, support growth, help repair a d otect our body from diseases, and maintain vanous ....-.. nctions are called nutrients. The major nutrients our food include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. Vitamins and minerals are also called protective nutrients. These nutrients protect our body from diseases and keep us healthy. Your parents may have advised you to have milk, green vegetables, fruits and wholegrains regularly. These food items are some sources of vitamins (Fig. 3.6) and minerals. Although vitamins and minerals are required in small amounts, they are essential to keep our body healthy. What differences do you observe in raw and cooked vegetables?	Have	you	ever	noticed	that	vegetables sometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and less crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and others are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it not be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into our diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may also result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is)i{hly recommended that all fruits and vegetables be thor ly washed before consumption. 0 We obtai nutrients t nts and an� ........---.-- Medu.	fro:U salet acarn:o:,.vm rocks. ,e Vitami an be	_	�'". natural	by our	,(J body u	e posure to	/ ght.	..,,,,,., \ and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see dietary fibres are beneficial for us. In addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary "  fibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do not provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage in our food is provided mainly by suitable plant products. Green	leafy	vegetables, fresh fruits, wholegrains, pulses and nuts are good sources of roughage. Eating	food		that		is locally	grown	and	plant based, to the extent possible, is not only healthy for the body but is also good for our environment and our planet.

This scheme has played a role in improving the health and nutrition of millions of children nationwide. 3.3 How to Test Different Components of Food? Let us find out which nutrients are present in various food items. Some nutrients like starch (a type of carbohydrate), fat and protein can be detected using fairly simple tests, while others can be detected only in a well-equipped laboratory. Let us explore how we can detect the presence of starch, fat and protein in some food items. 3.3.1 Test for starch Activity 3.5: Let us investigate ? Take a small quantity of the food items	e of potato, cucumber, b	e boiled"ff oi ed gram, crushed peanuts,		nd1:\._ oconut. You can take other	for  - esting for the presence of starch in various food items � ce a small piece of each item on a separate dish. (:)  With the help of a dropper, put 2-3 drops of diluted .N,.?	iodine solution on each food item (Fig. 3.7). "		Observe if there are any changes in the colour of the food items. Have they turned blue-black? Record your observations in Table 3.3. A blue-black colour indicates the presence of starch. 3.3.2 Test for fats Activity 3.6: Let us investigate ? Take a small part of the food items that you tested for the presence of starch in Activity 3.5. ? Place each food item on a separate piece of paper. ? Wrap the paper around the food and press it. Be careful not to tear the paper. ? If a food item contains a little water, allow the paper to dry. Does the paper develop an oily patch? What do you think	X. is the reason for this patch?

Such a person may suffer from several health problems. You should always remember Dr Poshita's statement that 'Health is the Ultimate Wealth.' We should take care of our body to stay healthy. Eating a balanced diet and avoiding junk food contribute towards a healthy body. Good health is essential for leading a happy life. Which of the two foods you studied in Activity 3.9 could be labelled as junk food? Packaged food items must have information about the nutrients on their cover. The information should list the amount of each nutrient. Sometimes, more Jrssa.i/ nutrients are added to the food during processing		 (fortification) to improve its nutritional quality. Iodised salt and some baby foods are examples of fortified foods. The Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) is a government agency that regulates food quality in India.

They contribute significantly to a balanced diet required for the normal functioning of our body. 3.6	Food Miles: From Farm to Our Plate How does food reach from a farm to our plate? What are the steps involved in this process? Who are the people involved in this process?

Reducing food miles is important "   ecause it helps to cut down the cost and pollution during its transport, it helps support local farmers, and it also keeps our food fresher and healthier. Many people waste food, leaving it unconsumed on their plates. One must remember the time and effort put by our farmers and other community members in getting the food from the farm to our plate. We must take only as much food as we can consume. It would reduce food wastage.
