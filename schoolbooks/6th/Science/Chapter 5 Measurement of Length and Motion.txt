Deepa, a curious eleven-year old girl, lives in a town of the state of Haryana. The new school year has started. Deepa needs a new uniform since she has grown taller. Her mother takes her to a cloth shop. She asks for a two-metre cloth piece. The shopkeeper measures th cloth using a metal measur �n  rod. Then, the tailor takes he   easureme.it using a flexible measuri				er m instructs the tailor to inc e			len t uniform by char angu	u	ngers	t	. Deepa shares her experience with her school friends Anish, Hardeep, Padma, Tasneem and this leads to a discussion amongst them. Deepa Anish	Hardeep	Padma '(/f;jm 5.1 How do we Meas ?	?

V Deepa and her friends are the length of the table with the length of their han ns. The length of the table is expressed in terms of A  handspans. Here, the handspan used for measurem t  example of a unit. And the length is expressed - o p'k, a number and a unit. For example, if the length	able is found to be 13 handspans, then 13 is the nu be and 'handspan' is the unit selected for the measur Howe  nandspans and other similar units, such as length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which measurements of the same length made by different people do not differ. India has a rich history of measurement systems dating back to ancient times. Angula (finger width), multiples of angula, dhanusa, and yojana are some of the units mentioned in ancient Indian literature, and used in measuring artefacts, architecture, and town planning. The angula is still used by traditional craftspeople like carpenters and tailors.

Note that a full stop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. Do you know? While writing the length, always leave a space between the number and the unit. 5.4 Measuring the Length of a Curved Line Anish and his parents fixed electric string lights on the arches of the verandah of their house, as shown in Fig. 5.7, for a celebration at home. How would they have measured the required length of string lights? In the case of a curved line, measurements can be made with the help of a flexible measuring tape or by using a thread as shown in Fig. 5.8.

She asks the students to reach the		inthe morning. Deepa and her friends start disc	whether the garden would be closer than their sci  or farther. Tasneem and Padma say that the gardey l be closer, while Deepa and Anish feel that the schoo u d be closer, Hardeep thinks that both would be st atanequal distance (Fig. 5.9).

All of them are correct (Fig. 5.9). Then, why are their observations different? They are locating the distances of the school and garden from their houses. If, instead, each of them had thought of distances from a same object or point, say, the bus stand, then their observations would have been the same. When distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or point, then this point is called a reference point. A few days later, Hardeep tells his friends excitedly, "Let us all go to the playground. The sports teacher wants us to help her to draw lines with chuna powder (limestone powder) for making the Kabaddi court for the sport y." Padma: "We will need a longer measuring tape. s take it from the sports room." (Fig. 5.10) Deepa: "Let us first decide the point	ound from which we will sure the d_t: ce		to start drawing the lines	us call,?	reference point." (Fig.5.1 A measuring tape Fig. 5.11: Drawing lines for Kabaddi court Fig. 5.12: A kilometre stone After a few days, Padma was travelling by bus to visit her grandparents in Delhi. She was eager to reach Delhi and was reading the kilometre stones on the side of the road. On one of the kilometre stones, it was written 'Delhi 70 km' (Fig. 5.12). Further on, the next kilometre stone read 'Delhi 60 km'. Each kilometre stone indicated to her that she was getting closer to her grandparents' house. If the kilometr e read"'_......,.,.lhi 70 km' as shown in Fig. 5.13, we can say tha t   � ion of Padma is 70 km from Delhi.

Record your observations in Table 5.3. Think about how you decided whether an object was in motion or at rest. Write your explanation (justification) in Table 5.3.

How  can  one "   ..d. ecide if an object is in motion or at rest? An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with respect to the reference point with time. If an object is not changing its position with respect to the reference point with time, it is said to be at rest. Deepa looked around her in the bus and noticed that all I	the passengers were seated. She looked around again after a minute and found them still occupying their seats. She wondered, 'Are they moving?' She concluded that the position of the passengers was not changing with time. Therefore, they were certainly at rest. However, when she looked outside, she felt they were in motion as their positions were changing with respect to things outside. The reference point is important in deciding whether an object is at rest or in motion. If Deepa considered herself (or the bus) as the reference point, then passengers were at rest. However, if she considered any object outside the bus (say a building) as the reference point, then	'(..I the passengers (and the bus) were inmo	---	?
