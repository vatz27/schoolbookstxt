His parents, teachers, and friends said that he did not know how to accept defeat. The fact was that        defeat: loss he could not bear losing, not even at marbles. He felt so good when he won that he never           on the contrary: wanted to give up that feeling. On the contrary,    just the opposite losing made him feel terrible.

He would take part only when he was sure of winning, even if the game lasted only for a minute. You could not stop him from playing the kind of games he was really good at, like badminton. A new student joined Prabhat’s school, and his name was Surya. Surya was an excellent badminton player. Prabhat waited for the last Friday of the month. Last Friday was significant.   significant: important This was when the coach conducted friendly matches in the games period. The teams were         conducted: organised decided on Monday and it was no surprise when Prabhat and Surya were chosen to play a round against each other.

He walked about the 104 Unit 4.indd 104                                                                13-Jun-24 10:59:39 AM Sports and Wellness whole time, smiling and cracking jokes about all sorts of things. But on Friday, at the badminton   phenomenon: court, Surya was a real phenomenon. He won         someone who has special points again and again, laughing and joking all qualities the time. However, Surya was paying so little attention to the match that Prabhat managed to change the scoreboard while his opponent was looking elsewhere. Prabhat managed to win by cheating. He made a big thing of his win, but it did not matter to Surya. “It’s been fun. We should play again some other time,” said Surya. 105 Unit 4.indd 105                                                              13-Jun-24 10:59:40 AM Poorvi—Grade 6 Let us discuss 1.

He had won the game but he did not feel as happy as he usually did. What was surprising was that Surya did not feel bad about losing. What was more surprising was that Prabhat saw 106 Unit 4.indd 106                                                                  13-Jun-24 10:59:41 AM Sports and Wellness Surya playing basketball the next day. Surya was so hopeless at it that he could not score a       hopeless: basket for ten minutes. Yet, he enjoyed playing       having no skill in something the game. His happy smile never left his face. Prabhat kept a close watch on Surya for           kept a close some days. He was great at some things,               watch on: terrible at others but what was common was            observed the enjoyment. He enjoyed everything equally. As Prabhat went on with his observation, he realised that to enjoy a game, you did not need a scoreboard to keep a tally of your scores. Neither did you have to worry about winning and losing. You needed to enjoy the game for its own sake. What matters is trying to do well, and enjoying every moment of it. Prabhat learnt something through the observations every day, soon realising the change in himself. He had even begun playing hide and seek, and felt sad whenever it was about to end. He also started joking while playing badminton.

The word           originated: ‘Yoga’ comes from the Sanskrit root ‘yuj’, which     started means ‘to join’ or ‘to unite’. This symbolises the unity of mind and body; thought and action; harmony between human and nature. It is a            harmony: holistic approach to health and well-being.          balance Sage Patanjali presented the ancient tradition of yoga in a systematic way in ‘Yoga Sutras of Patanjali’. He described yoga as the means to make the mind quiet and free from all distractions.                                    distractions: Yoga has become increasingly popular             disturbances around the world due to its many health benefits. 122 Unit 4.indd 122                                                                  13-Jun-24 10:59:44 AM Sports and Wellness Here are some of the benefits of yoga— • Yoga postures (asanas) help to stretch and strengthen the muscles, increase flexibility, endurance and balance.

Yoga promotes a sense of     overall      well-being. This is the reason why the benefits of practising yoga    are    internationally recognised.     The      World Health Organisation (WHO) on 20th June 2021, launched an App called WHO mYoga. The app contains a collection of videos and audio files to teach and support yoga practice. The aim was to have an easy-to-use and free tool for people across the world to encourage them to practise yoga. 123 Unit 4.indd 123                                                               13-Jun-24 10:59:44 AM Poorvi—Grade 6 We can start practicing yoga at any given moment of time. We must remember that when we practice yoga asanas (postures), we do not just stretch the body. The mind has to be with the body. This is the reason why it should be practised without distractions. If each stretch is coordinated with the breath and awareness, our practice will become a yogic practice. हठस्‍य प्रथमा�त्‍वादासनं परू ्वमच्ु ‍यते। कुर्यात्तदासनं स्‍थैर्यमारोग्‍यं चा��ाघवम् ।।१९।। haṭhasya prathamāṅgatvādāsanam pūrvamuchyate kuryāttadāsanam sthairyamārogyam chāṅgalāghavam Being the first accessory of Hatha-Yoga, āsana is described first.
