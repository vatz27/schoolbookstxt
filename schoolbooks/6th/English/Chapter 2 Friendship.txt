The king was fond of Gajaraj, and he had ordered that the elephant should be well looked after. In spite of royal comforts, Gajaraj was sad because he had no friends. The mahout, or elephant trainer, was the only one he ever interacted with. The mahout was a kind man who served Gajaraj food, and gave him a bath in the elephant pond daily. He was a good caretaker, but not a friend. “I wish I had a friend I can play with,” thought Gajaraj. One late evening, a dog strayed into the stable.

The visitor wagged his tail, looked up at the elephant to convey his thanks, and then turned his full attention to the food in front of him. As soon as he finished eating, he fell asleep. The next morning, the mahout found the stray dog in the stable. He did not mind the dog. He also noticed that Gajaraj seemed to like the company. So, he threw some crumbs to the dog, which the animal accepted wagging his tail. When the elephant went out for a bath, the dog accompanied his friend. Plunging into the water, the elephant gave himself a shower using his long trunk, as the dog watched. The elephant took a trunkful of water and playfully splashed the water on his friend. The dog yelped for he hated taking showers. The mahout laughed. munching: chewing wagged: moved from side to side convey: communicate accompanied: went with someone plunging: jumping in trunk: long nose yelped: cried splashed: threw crumbs: small pieces of food 41 Unit 2.indd   41 13-Jun-24   11:52:13 AM 42 Poorvi—Grade 6 On their way home, the elephant picked up the dog with his trunk and placed him on his back. The dog was delighted to get a ride. A farmer passing by saw the dog. “Buntee,” he yelled. The dog ran to him. The farmer hugged the dog and told the mahout that he was looking for his dog ever since he disappeared from his house. He was glad he found him now. The mahout had no objection to the farmer taking the dog home. The farmer tossed a rope round the neck of the dog, saying, “Come Buntee, let’s go home.” Let us discuss disappeared: was not seen delighted: happy hugged: held closely 1.

He yelped, the elephant winced, but neither the farmer nor the mahout noticed that the two friends were in tears. The next day at lunch time the mahout served Gajaraj his favourite food.

The elephant did not react. “He may have slight indigestion. Let me not force him to eat,” thought the mahout. That night too, Gajaraj did not touch his food—nor the next day. Now, the mahout was worried. He ran his hand on Gajaraj’s tummy and felt there was nothing wrong. “Why was he not eating then? Is he missing his friend, that dog?” the mahout wondered. Meanwhile at the farmer’s house, the dog had also not touched his food ever since he was brought home. “Are you missing your friend?” asked the farmer remembering the happy look on Buntee’s face while sitting on the elephant’s back. “I cannot see you go hungry,” said the farmer, “If you miss your friend so much, go to him.” The farmer removed the rope with which he had tied the dog.

He quickly brought the food. “Both of you eat first,” he said. By then the farmer who had followed the dog, joined him. The two of them watched with satisfaction the two friends eating food. “It’s not only Gajaraj who has found a friend,” said the mahout hugging the farmer, “I’ve also found one.” Subba Rao kathakids.com satisfaction: happiness joyous: happy relieved: thankful swing: move side to side or back and forth sprang: jumped Let us discuss 1.

Gajaraj was sad without a friend and when he met Buntee, he was filled with joy. ‘Sad’ and ‘filled with joy’ are opposites. Opposites can also be formed by adding some letters before a word. For example, un- unhappy, in- incorrect, dis- disconnect, mis- misuse. Now, take help from the words given as hints and fill up their opposites in the puzzle. (Note: All the words are from the story you have just read.) Unit 2.indd   46 13-Jun-24   11:52:14 AM 47 Friendship We are opposites!

In the story, the author tells us what happened before. To do that, the past form of the action word (verb) is used. Let us learn about the three forms of past tense. Simple Past Tense Past Progressive Tense Past Perfect Tense Used to show that the action had happened earlier. • second form of the verb + add -d or -ed to the verb Used to show that the action did not finish and was going on. • I/He/She/It + was + verb + ing • We/You/They + were + verb + ing Used to show that the action was completed. • had + third form of the verb Given below are some verbs from the story. Put the verbs in their correct column in the table given above. • was looking looked gave had ordered • was missing hated had followed noticed • was munching went had remained served • told asked felt touched • had tied joined arrived threw Unit 2.indd   48 13-Jun-24   11:52:14 AM 49 Friendship Select the correct form of the verb to complete the passage. Check your answers with the teacher. The farmer came back and ____________ (noticed/was noticing/had noticed) that Buntee was sad. He ____________ (tied/ was tying/had tied) Buntee with a rope the day before. He ____________ (asked/was asking/ had asked) Buntee why he was sad. Farmer ____________ (felt/was feeling/ had felt) that Buntee ____________ (missed/was missing/had missed) Gajaraj and set him free. 4. ‘…neither the farmer nor the mahout noticed that the two friends were in tears.’ The words ‘neither’, ‘nor’ are used to state that the farmer and the mahout did not notice the same thing. ‘Neither, nor’ connect two negative choices. For example: Neither Rohit nor I want to play football. When you need to choose between two things that you want, you may use ‘either, or’. For example: Rohit wants to play either cricket or kho-kho. It means Rohit wants to play cricket or Rohit wants to play kho-kho. Discuss the given sentences with your teacher to practice. • Neither Shikha nor Anuj like to tell stories. • Either Bhavesh or Abha made this painting. Let us listen 1.

He showed off a lot, always talking about how many friends he had at school, and how he was so friendly with everyone. One day his grandfather said to him, “Mario, I bet you a fruit chaat. You don’t have as many friends as you think you have. I’m sure many of them are nothing more than companions or partners.” Mario accepted the bet readily. However, he wasn’t sure how he could test whether his schoolmates were real friends or not. So, he asked his grandpa for help. He suggested, “I have exactly what you need. It’s in the attic. Wait here a minute.” Grandpa left, soon returning as though carrying something in his hand, but Mario could see nothing there. “Take it. It’s a very special chair. As it’s invisible, it’s rather tricky to sit on it. But if you take it to school and manage to sit on it, then attic: a storage space in a house just under the roof accepted: agreed to readily: without any problem showed off: boasted invisible: impossible to see Unit 2.indd   60 13-Jun-24   11:52:19 AM Friendship the magic will work and you’ll be able to tell who your real friends are.” Let us discuss 1.
