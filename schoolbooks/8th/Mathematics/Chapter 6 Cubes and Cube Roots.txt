Once another famous mathematician Prof. G.H. Hardy came to visit him in a taxi whose number was 1729. While talking to Ramanujan, Hardy described this number “a dull number”. Ramanujan quickly pointed out that 1729 was indeed Hardy – Ramanujan Number interesting. He said it is the smallest  number that can be expressed as a sum of two cubes in two different ways: 1729 is the smallest Hardy– Ramanujan Number. There 1729 = 1728 + 1 = 123 + 13 are an infinitely many such 1729 = 1000 + 729 = 103 + 93 numbers. Few are 4104 1729 has since been known as the Hardy – Ramanujan Number, (2, 16; 9, 15), 13832 (18, 20; even though this feature of 1729 was known more than 300 years 2, 24), Check it with the before Ramanujan. numbers given in the brackets. How did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All through his life, he experimented with numbers. He probably found numbers that were expressed as the sum of two squares and sum of two cubes also. There are many other interesting patterns of cubes. Let us learn about cubes, cube roots and many other interesting facts related to them. Figures which have 6.2  Cubes 3-dimensions are known as You know that the word ‘cube’ is used in geometry. A cube is solid figures. a solid figure which has all its sides equal. How many cubes of side 1 cm will make a cube of side 2 cm? How many cubes of side 1 cm will make a cube of side 3 cm? Consider the numbers 1, 8, 27, ... These are called perfect cubes or cube numbers. Can you say why they are named so? Each of them is obtained when a number is multiplied by taking it three times. Reprint 2024-25   We note that 1 = 1 × 1 × 1 = 13;  8 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 23; 27 = 3 × 3 × 3 = 33. Since 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125, therefore 125 is a cube number. Is 9 a cube number? No, as 9 = 3 × 3 and there is no natural number which multiplied by taking three times gives 9. We can see also that 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 and 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. This shows that 9 is not a perfect cube. The following are the cubes of numbers from 1 to 10.

Prime factorisation Prime factorisation each prime factor of a number of its cube appears three times in its cubes 4 = 2 × 2 43 = 64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 23 × 23 6 = 2 × 3 63 = 216 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 33 15 = 3 × 5 153 = 3375 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 33 × 53 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 123 = 1728 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 23 × 33 Reprint 2024-25   Observe that each prime factor of a number appears 2 216 three times in the prime factorisation of its cube. Do you remember that 2 108 In the prime factorisation of any number, if each factor am × bm = (a × b)m 2 54 appears three times, then, is the number a perfect cube? 3 27 Think about it. Is 216 a perfect cube? 3 9 By prime factorisation, 216 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 3 3 Each factor appears 3 times. 216 = 23 × 33 = (2 × 3)3 1 = 63   which is a perfect cube! factors can be grouped in triples Is 729 a perfect cube? 729 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 Yes, 729 is a perfect cube. Now let us check for 500. Prime factorisation of 500 is 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5. So, 500 is not a perfect cube. Example 1: Is 243 a perfect cube? There are three 5’s in the product but only two 2’s. Solution: 243 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 In the above factorisation 3 × 3 remains after grouping the 3’s in triplets. Therefore, 243 is not a perfect cube. TRY THESE Which of the following are perfect cubes? 1. 400 2. 3375 3. 8000 4. 15625 5. 9000 6. 6859 7. 2025 8. 10648 6.2.2  Smallest multiple that is a perfect cube Raj made a cuboid of plasticine. Length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 cm, 30 cm, 15 cm respectively. Anu asks how many such cuboids will she need to make a perfect cube? Can you tell? Raj said, Volume of cuboid is 15 × 30 × 15  = 3 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 3 × 5 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 Since there is only one 2 in the prime factorisation. So we need 2 × 2, i.e., 4 to make it a perfect cube. Therefore, we need 4 such cuboids to make a cube. Example 2: Is 392 a perfect cube? If not, find the smallest natural number by which 392 must be multiplied so that the product is a perfect cube. Solution: 392 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7 The prime factor 7 does not appear in a group of three. Therefore, 392 is not a perfect cube. To make its a cube, we need one more 7. In that case 392 × 7 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7 × 7 = 2744           which is a perfect cube. Reprint 2024-25   Hence the smallest natural number by which 392 should be multiplied to make a perfect cube is 7. Example 3: Is 53240 a perfect cube? If not, then by which smallest natural number should 53240 be divided so that the quotient is a perfect cube? Solution: 53240 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 11 × 11 × 11 × 5 The prime factor 5 does not appear in a group of three. So, 53240 is not a perfect cube. In the factorisation 5 appears only one time. If we divide the number by 5, then the prime factorisation of the quotient will not contain 5. So, 53240 ÷ 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 11 × 11 × 11 Hence the smallest number by which 53240 should be divided to make it a perfect cube is 5. The perfect cube in that case is = 10648. Example 4: Is 1188 a perfect cube? If not, by which smallest natural number should 1188 be divided so that the quotient is a perfect cube? Solution: 1188 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 11 The primes 2 and 11 do not appear in groups of three. So, 1188 is not a perfect cube. In the factorisation of 1188 the prime 2 appears only two times and the prime 11 appears once. So, if we divide 1188 by 2 × 2 × 11 = 44, then the prime factorisation of the quotient will not contain 2 and 11. Hence the smallest natural number by which 1188 should be divided to make it a perfect cube is 44. And the resulting perfect cube is 1188 ÷ 44 = 27 (=33). Example 5: Is 68600 a perfect cube? If not, find the smallest number by which 68600 must be multiplied to get a perfect cube. Solution: We have, 68600 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 7. In this factorisation, we find that there is no triplet of 5. So, 68600 is not a perfect cube. To make it  a perfect cube we multiply it by 5. Thus, 68600 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 7 = 343000,   which is a perfect cube. Observe that 343 is a perfect cube. From Example 5 we know that 343000 is also perfect cube.

Parikshit makes a cuboid of plasticine of sides 5 cm, 2 cm, 5 cm. How many such cuboids will he need to form a cube? 6.3  Cube Roots If the volume of a cube is 125 cm3, what would be the length of its side? To get the length of the side of the cube, we need to know a number whose cube is 125. Finding the square root, as you know, is the inverse operation of squaring. Similarly, finding the cube root is the inverse operation of finding cube. We know that 23 = 8; so we say that the cube root of 8 is 2. We write 3 8  = 2. The symbol 3  denotes ‘cube-root.’ Consider the following: Statement Inference Statement Inference 13 = 1 3 1  = 1 63 = 216 3 216  = 6 23 = 8 3 8  = 3 23 = 2 73 = 343 3 343  = 7 33 = 27 3 27  = 3 33  = 3 83 = 512 3 512  = 8 43 = 64 3 64  = 4 93 =  729 3 729  = 9 53 = 125 3 125  = 5 103 = 1000 3 1000  = 10 6.3.1  Cube root through prime factorisation method Consider 3375. We find its cube root by prime factorisation: 3375 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 33 × 53 = (3 × 5)3 Therefore, cube root of 3375 = 3 3375 = 3 × 5 = 15 Similarly, to find 3 74088 , we have, Reprint 2024-25   74088 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 7 × 7 = 23 × 33 × 73 = (2 × 3 × 7)3 Therefore, 3 74088  = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42 Example 6: Find the cube root of 8000. Solution: Prime factorisation of 8000 is 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5 So, 3 8000  = 2 × 2 × 5 = 20 Example 7: Find the cube root of 13824 by prime factorisation method. Solution: 13824 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 23 × 23 × 33. Therefore, 3 13824  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 24 THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE State true or false: for any integer m, m2 < m3.
