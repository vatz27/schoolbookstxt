Since, 4 can be expressed as 2 × 2 = 22, 9 can be expressed as 3 × 3 = 32, all such numbers can be expressed as the product of the number with itself. Such numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... are known as square numbers. In general, if a natural number m can be expressed as n2, where n is also a natural number, then m is a square number. Is 32 a square number? We know that 52 = 25 and 62 = 36. If 32 is a square number, it must be the square of a natural number  between 5 and 6. But there is no natural number between 5 and 6. Therefore 32 is not a square number. Consider the following numbers and their squares.

Numbers between square numbers Let us now see if we can find some interesting pattern between two consecutive square numbers. Two non square numbers 1 (= 12 6 non square numbers between ) between the two square the two square numbers 9(=32) numbers 1 (=12) and 4(=22). and 16(= 42). 2, 3, 4 (= 22) 8 non square 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (= 32) numbers between the two square 4 non square numbers numbers 16(= 42 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (= 42 ) ) between the two square and 25(=52). numbers 4(=22) and 9(32). 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (= 52) Between 12(=1) and 22(= 4) there are two (i.e., 2 × 1) non square numbers 2, 3. Between 22(= 4) and 32(= 9) there are four (i.e., 2 × 2) non square numbers 5, 6, 7, 8. Now, 32 = 9,       42 = 16 Therefore, 42 – 32 = 16 – 9 = 7 Between 9(=32) and 16(= 42) the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 that is, six non-square numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares. We have 42 = 16     and     52 = 25 Therefore, 52 – 42 = 9 Between 16(= 42) and 25(= 52) the numbers are 17, 18, ... , 24 that is, eight non square numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares. Consider 72 and 62. Can you say how many numbers are there between 62 and 72? If we think of any natural number n and (n + 1), then, (n + 1)2 – n2 = (n2 + 2n + 1) – n2 = 2n + 1. We find that between n2 and (n + 1)2 there are 2n numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares. Thus, in general we can say that there are 2n non perfect square numbers between the squares of the numbers n and (n + 1). Check for n = 5, n = 6 etc., and verify.

Looking at it in a different way, we can say: ‘If the number is a square number, it has to be the sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1. Consider those numbers which are not perfect squares, say 2, 3, 5, 6, ... . Can you express these numbers as a sum of successive odd natural numbers beginning from 1? You will find that these numbers cannot be expressed in this form. Consider the number 25. Successively subtract 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... from it (i) 25 – 1 = 24 (ii) 24 – 3 = 21 (iii) 21 – 5 = 16 (iv) 16 – 7 = 9 (v) 9 – 9 = 0 This means, 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9. Also, 25 is a perfect square. Now consider another number 38, and again do as above. (i) 38 – 1 = 37 (ii) 37 – 3 = 34 (iii) 34 – 5 = 29 (iv) 29 – 7 = 22 (v) 22 – 9 = 13 (vi) 13 – 11 = 2 (vii) 2 – 13 = – 11 This shows that we are not able to express 38 as the TRY THESE sum of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1.

Product of two consecutive even or odd natural numbers 11 × 13 = 143 = 122 – 1 Also 11 × 13 = (12 – 1) × (12 + 1) Therefore, 11 × 13 = (12 – 1) × (12 + 1) = 122 – 1 Similarly, 13 × 15 = (14 – 1) × (14 + 1) = 142 – 1 29 × 31 = (30 – 1) × (30 + 1) = 302 – 1 44 × 46 = (45 – 1) × (45 + 1) = 452 – 1 So in general we can say that (a + 1) × (a – 1) = a2 – 1. 6.

The numbers 5, 12, 13 form another such triplet. Reprint 2024-25   Can you find more such triplets? For any natural number m > 1, we have (2m)2 + (m2 – 1)2 = (m2 + 1)2. So, 2m, m2 – 1 and m2 + 1 forms a Pythagorean triplet. Try to find some more Pythagorean triplets using this form. Example 2: Write a Pythagorean triplet whose smallest member is 8. Solution: We can get Pythagorean triplets by using general form 2m, m2 – 1, m2 + 1. Let us first take m2 – 1 = 8 So, m2 = 8 + 1 = 9 which gives m = 3 Therefore, 2m = 6   and    m2 + 1 = 10 The triplet is thus 6, 8, 10.  But 8 is not the smallest member of this. So, let us try 2m = 8 then m = 4 We get m2 – 1 = 16 – 1 = 15 and m2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 The triplet is 8, 15, 17 with 8 as the smallest member. Example 3: Find a Pythagorean triplet in which one member is 12. Solution: If we take m2 – 1 = 12 Then, m2 = 12 + 1 = 13 Then the value of m will not be an integer. So, we try to take m2 + 1 = 12. Again m2 = 11 will not give an integer value for m. So, let us take 2m = 12 then m = 6 Thus, m2 – 1 = 36 – 1 = 35    and m2 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37 Therefore, the required triplet is 12, 35, 37. Note: All Pythagorean triplets may not be obtained using this form. For example another triplet 5, 12, 13 also has 12 as a member. EXERCISE 5.2 1. Find the square of the following numbers.

(b) What is the length of a diagonal of a square of side 8 cm (Fig 5.1)? Can we use Pythagoras theorem to solve this ? We have, AB2 + BC2 = AC2 i.e., 82 + 82 = AC2 or 64 + 64 = AC2 or 128 = AC2 Again to get AC we need to think of a number whose square is 128. Fig 5.1 (c) In a right triangle the length of the hypotenuse and a side are respectively 5 cm and 3 cm (Fig 5.2). Can you find the third side? Let x cm be the length of the third side. Using Pythagoras theorem 52 = x2 + 32 25 – 9 =  x2 16 = x 2 Fig 5.2 Again, to find x we need a number whose square is 16. In all the above cases, we need to find a number whose square is known. Finding the number with the known square is known as finding the square root. 5.5.1  Finding square roots The inverse (opposite) operation of addition is subtraction and the inverse operation of multiplication is division. Similarly, finding the square root is the inverse operation of squaring. We have, 12 = 1, therefore square root of 1 is 1 22 = 4, therefore square root of 4 is 2 Since 92 = 81, 32 = 9, therefore square root of 9 is 3 and (–9)2 = 81 We say that square roots of 81 are 9 and –9.

Let us use this to find the square root of a given square number, say 324. 3 27 We know that the prime factorisation of 324 is 3 9 324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 3 Reprint 2024-25   By pairing the prime factors, we get 324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3  = 22 × 32 × 32 = (2 × 3 × 3)2 So, 324 = 2 × 3 × 3 = 18 Similarly can you find the square root of 256? Prime factorisation of 256 is 2 256 256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 2 128 By pairing the prime factors we get, 2 64 256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)2 2 32 Therefore, 256  =  2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16 2 16 Is 48 a perfect square? 2 8 We know 48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 2 4 Since all the factors are not in pairs so 48 is not a perfect square. 2 Suppose we want to find the smallest multiple of 48 that is a perfect square, how should we proceed? Making pairs of the prime factors of 48 we see that 3 is the only factor that does not have a pair. So we need to multiply by 3 to complete the pair. Hence 48 × 3 = 144 is a perfect square. 2 6400 Can you tell by which number should we divide 48 to get a perfect square? 2 3200 The factor 3 is not in pair, so if we divide 48 by 3 we get 48 ÷ 3 = 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 2 1600 and this number 16 is a perfect square too. 2 800 Example 4: Find the square root of 6400. 2 400 Solution: Write 6400 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 2 200 2 100 Therefore 6400  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 80 2 90 3 45 2 50 Example 5: Is 90 a perfect square? 3 15 5 25 Solution: We have 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 5 5 The prime factors 2 and 5 do not occur in pairs. Therefore, 90 is not a perfect square. That 90 is not a perfect square can also be seen from the fact that  it has only one zero. Example 6: Is 2352 a perfect square? If not, find the smallest multiple of 2352 which 2 2352 is a perfect square. Find the square root of the new number. 2 1176 Solution: We have 2352 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7 2 588 As the prime factor 3 has no pair, 2352 is not a perfect square. 2 294 If 3 gets a pair then the number will become perfect square. So, we multiply 2352 by 3 to get, 3 147 2352 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 7 7 49 Now each prime factor is in a pair. Therefore, 2352 × 3 = 7056   is a perfect square. 7 Thus the required smallest multiple of 2352 is 7056 which is a perfect square. And, 7056  = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 84 Example 7: Find the smallest number by which 9408 must be divided so that the quotient is a perfect square. Find the square root of the quotient. Reprint 2024-25   Solution: We have, 9408 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7 If we divide 9408 by the factor 3, then 9408 ÷ 3 = 3136 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7  which is a perfect square. (Why?) Therefore, the required smallest number is 3. And, 3136  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 = 56. 2 6, 9, 15 Example 8:  Find the smallest square number which is divisible by each of the numbers 3 3, 9, 15 6, 9 and 15. 3 1, 3, 5 Solution: This has to be done in two steps. First find the smallest common multiple and 5 1, 1, 5 then find the square number needed. The least number divisible by each one of 6, 9 and 1, 1, 1 15 is their LCM. The LCM of 6, 9 and 15 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90. Prime factorisation of 90 is 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5. We see that prime factors 2 and 5 are not in pairs. Therefore 90 is not a perfect square. In order to get a perfect square, each factor of 90 must be paired. So we need to make pairs of 2 and 5. Therefore, 90 should be multiplied by 2 × 5, i.e., 10. Hence, the required square number is 90 × 10 = 900. EXERCISE 5.3 1. What could be the possible ‘one’s’ digits of the square root of each of the following numbers?

Find the smallest square number that is divisible by each of the numbers 8, 15 and 20. 5.5.4  Finding square root by division method When the numbers are large, even the method of finding square root by prime factorisation becomes lengthy and difficult. To overcome this problem we use Long Division Method. For this we need to determine the number of digits in the square root. See the following table: Number Square 10 100 which is the smallest 3-digit perfect square 31 961 which is the greatest 3-digit perfect square 32 1024 which is the smallest 4-digit perfect square 99 9801 which is the greatest 4-digit perfect square So, what can we say about the number of digits in the square root if a perfect square is a 3-digit or a 4-digit number? We can say that, if a perfect square is a 3-digit or a 4-digit number, then its square root will have 2-digits. Can you tell the number of digits in the square root of a 5-digit or a 6-digit perfect square?
