A basket has two types of fruits, say, 20 apples and 5 oranges. Then, the ratio of the number of oranges to the number of apples = 5 : 20. 5 1 The comparison can be done by using fractions as,  = 20 4 1 The number of oranges is th the number of apples. In terms of ratio, this is 4 1 : 4, read as, “1 is to 4” OR 20 4 Number of apples to number of oranges = =   which means, the number of apples 5 1 is  4 times the number of oranges. This comparison can also be done using percentages. There are 5 oranges out of 25 fruits. By unitary method: So percentage of oranges is Out of 25 fruits, number of oranges are 5. 5 4 20 So out of 100 fruits, number of oranges × = = 20% OR 25 4 100 5 = × 100  = 20. [Denominator made 100]. 25 Since  contains only apples and oranges, So, percentage of apples + percentage of oranges = 100 or percentage of apples + 20 = 100 or percentage of apples = 100 – 20 = 80 Thus the basket has 20% oranges and 80% apples. Example 1: A picnic is being planned in a school for Class VII. Girls are 60% of the total number of students and are 18 in number. The picnic site is 55 km from the school and the transport company is charging at the rate of  12 per km. The total cost of refreshments will be  4280.

If their first stop is at a place 22 km from the school, what per cent of the total distance of 55 km is this? What per cent of the distance is left to be covered? Solution: 1. To find the ratio of girls to boys. Ashima and John came up with the following answers. They needed to know the number of boys and also the total number of students. Ashima did this John used the unitary method Let the total number of students There are 60 girls out of 100 students. 100 be x. 60% of x is girls. There is one girl out of  students. 60 Therefore, 60% of x = 18 So, 18 girls are out of  how many students? 60 100 × x  =  18 OR Number of students = × 18 100 60 18 × 100 or,  x =  = 30  = 30 60 Number of students = 30. So, the number of boys = 30 – 18 = 12. 18 3 Hence, ratio of the number of girls to the number of boys is 18 : 12 or  = . 12 2 3 is written as 3 : 2 and read as 3 is to 2. 2 2. To find the cost per person. Transportation charge = Distance both ways × Rate =  (55 × 2) × 12 =  110 × 12 =  1320 Total expenses = Refreshment charge + Transportation charge =  4280 +  1320 =  5600 Total number of persons =18 girls + 12 boys + 2 teachers = 32 persons Ashima and John then used unitary method to find the cost per head. For 32 persons, amount spent would be  5600. 5600 The amount spent for 1 person =   =  175. 32 3. The distance of the place where first stop was made = 22 km.

That is 40% of the total distance is travelled. Both came out with the same answer that the distance from their school of the place where they stopped at was 40% of the total distance they had to travel. Therefore, the percent distance left to be travelled = 100% – 40% = 60%.

This is generally given to attract customers to buy goods or to promote sales of the goods. You can find the discount by subtracting its sale price from its marked price. So, Discount = Marked price – Sale price Example 2: An item marked at  840 is sold for  714. What is the discount and discount %? Solution: Discount = Marked Price – Sale Price =  840 –  714 =  126 Since discount is on marked price, we will have to use marked price as the base. On marked price of  840, the discount is  126. On MP of  100, how much will the discount be? 126 Discount = × 100%  = 15% 840 You can also find discount when discount % is given. Example 3: The list price of a frock is  220. A discount of 20% is announced on sales. What is the amount of discount on it and its sale price. Solution: Marked price is same as the list price. 20% discount means that on  100 (MP), the discount is  20. 20 By unitary method, on 1 the discount will be  . 100 20 On  220,  discount =  × 220  =  44 100 The sale price = ( 220 –  44) or   176 Rehana found the sale price like this — A discount of 20% means for a MP of  100, discount is  20.

Bill No. Date Menu S.No. Item Quantity Rate Amount Bill amount + ST (5%) Total Reprint 2024-25   Sales tax (ST) is charged by the government on the sale of an item. It is collected by the shopkeeper from the customer and given to the government. This is, therefore, always on the selling price of an item and is added to the value of the bill. There is another type of tax which is included in the prices known as Value Added Tax (VAT). From July 1, 2017, Government of India introduced GST which stands for Goods and Services Tax which is levied on supply of goods or services or both. Example 4: (Finding Sales Tax) The cost of a pair of roller skates at a shop was  450. The sales tax charged was 5%. Find the bill amount. Solution:  On  100, the tax paid was  5. 5 On  450, the tax paid would be =  × 450 100 =  22.50 Bill amount = Cost of item + Sales tax =  450 +  22.50 =  472.50. Example 5: (Value Added Tax (VAT)) Waheeda bought an air cooler for  3300 including a tax of 10%. Find the price of the air cooler before VAT was added. Solution: The price includes the VAT, i.e., the value added tax. Thus, a 10% VAT means if the price without VAT is  100 then price including VAT is  110. Now, when price including VAT is  110, original price is  100. 100 Hence when price including tax is  3300, the original price =   ×3300 = 3000. 110 Example 6: Salim bought an article for  784 which included GST of 12% . What is the price of the article before GST was added? Solution: Let original price of the article be   100.  GST = 12%. Price after GST is included =  (100+12) =  112 When the selling price is  112 then original price =  100.

Find the price of the article before GST was added? 7.4  Compound Interest You might have come across statements like “one year interest for FD (fixed deposit) in the bank @ 9% per annum” or ‘Savings account with interest @ 5% per annum’. Interest is the extra money paid by institutions like banks or post offices on money deposited (kept) with them. Interest is also paid by people when they borrow money. We already know how to calculate Simple Interest. Example 7: A sum of  10,000 is borrowed at a rate of interest 15% per annum for 2 years. Find the simple interest on this sum and the amount to be paid at the end of 2 years. Solution: On  100, interest charged for 1 year is  15. 15 So, on  10,000, interest charged  = × 10000 =  1500 100 Interest for 2 years =  1500 × 2 =  3000 Amount to be paid at the end of 2 years = Principal + Interest =  10000 +  3000 =  13000 TRY THESE Find interest and amount to be paid on  15000 at 5% per annum after 2 years. My father has kept some money in the post office for 3 years. Every year the money increases as more than the previous year. We have some money in the bank. Every year some interest is added to it, which is shown in the passbook. This interest is not the same, each year it increases. Reprint 2024-25   Normally, the interest paid or charged is never simple. The interest is calculated on the amount of the previous year. This is known as interest compounded or Compound Interest (C.I.). Let us take an example and find the interest year by year. Each year our sum or principal changes. Calculating Compound Interest A sum of  20,000 is borrowed by Heena for 2 years at an interest of 8% compounded annually. Find the Compound Interest (C.I.) and the amount she has to pay at the end of 2 years. Aslam asked the teacher whether this means that they should find the interest year by year. The teacher said ‘yes’,  and asked him to use the following steps : 1. Find the Simple Interest (S.I.) for one year. Let the principal for the first year be P . Here, P  =  20,000 1 1 20000×8 SI  = SI at 8% p.a. for 1st year =   =  1600 1 100 2. Then find the amount which will be paid or received. This becomes principal for the next year. Amount at the end of 1st year = P  + SI  =  20000 +  1600 1 1 =  21600 = P  (Principal for 2nd year) 2 3. Again find the interest on this sum for another year. 21600 × 8 SI  = SI at 8% p.a.for 2nd year =  2 100 =  1728 4. Find the amount which has to be paid or received at the end of second year. Amount at the end of 2nd year = P  + SI 2 2 =  21600 +  1728 =  23328 Total interest given =  1600 +  1728 =  3328 Reeta asked whether the amount would be different for simple interest. The teacher told her to find the  interest for two years and see for herself. 20000×8× 2 SI for 2 years =   =  3200 100 Reeta said that when compound interest was used Heena would pay  128 more. Let us look at the difference between simple interest and compound interest. We start with  100. Try completing the chart.

Year-end amount (120 + 10) =  130  133.10 Note that in 3 years, Interest earned by Simple Interest =  (130 – 100) =  30, whereas, Interest earned by Compound Interest =  (133.10 – 100) =  33.10 Note also that the Principal remains the same under Simple Interest, while it changes year after year under compound interest. 7.5 Deducing a Formula for Compound Interest Zubeda asked her teacher, ‘Is  there an easier way to find compound interest?’ The teacher said ‘There is a shorter way of finding compound interest. Let us try to find it.’ Suppose P  is the sum on which interest is compounded annually at a rate of R% 1 per annum. Let P  =  5000 and R = 5. Then by the steps mentioned above 1 5000 × 5×1 P1 × R × 1 1.

Aruna at once said that we know CI = A – P, so we can easily find the compound interest too.

Here are a few. (i) Increase (or decrease) in population. (ii) The growth of a bacteria if the rate of growth is known. (iii) The value of an item, if its price increases or decreases in the intermediate years. Example 9:  The population of a city was 20,000 in the year 1997. It increased at the rate of 5% p.a. Find the population at the end of the year 2000. Solution:  There is 5% increase in population every year, so every new year has new population. Thus, we can say it is increasing in compounded form. Population in the beginning of 1998 = 20000  (we treat this as the principal for the 1st year) 5 Increase at 5% =  × 20000 = 1000 100 Treat as Population in 1999 = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 the Principal for the 5 2nd year. Increase at 5% =  × 21000 = 1050 100 Population in 2000 = 21000 + 1050 Treat as = 22050 the Principal 5 for the Increase at 5% =  × 22050 3rd year. 100 = 1102.5 At the end of 2000 the population = 22050 + 1102.5 = 23152.5 3  5  or, Population at the end of 2000 = 20000 1+  100 21 21 21 = 20000 × × × 20 20 20 = 23152.5 So, the estimated population = 23153.
