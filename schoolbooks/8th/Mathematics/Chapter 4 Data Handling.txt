(b) Number of wickets taken by a bowler in the last 10 ODIs. (c) Marks scored by the students of your class in the Mathematics unit test. (d) Number of story books read by each of your friends etc. The information collected in all such cases is called data. Data is usually collected in the context of a situation that we want to study. For example, a teacher may like to know the average height of students in her class. To find this, she will write the heights of all the students in her class, organise the data in a systematic manner and then interpret it accordingly. Sometimes, data is represented graphically to give a clear idea of what it represents. Do you remember the different types of graphs which we have learnt in earlier classes? 1. A Pictograph: Pictorial representation of data using symbols. = 100 cars ←  One symbol stands for 100 cars 1 July = 250            denotes of 100 2 August = 300 September = ?

The time spent by a child during a day Age groups of people in a town (i) Fig 4.1 (ii) These are called circle graphs. A circle graph shows the relationship between a whole and its parts. Here, the whole circle is divided into sectors. The size of each sector is proportional to the activity or information it represents.

Similarly, the proportion of the sector 3 number of school hours 6 hours 1 for hours  spent in school =  = = whole day 24 hours 4 1 So this sector is drawn th of  the circle. Similarly, the size of other sectors can be found. 4 Add up the fractions for all the activities. Do you get the total as one? A circle graph is also called a pie chart. TRY THESE 1.

However, by chance, one day you forget to take the raincoat and it rains heavily on that day. Sometimes it so happens that a student prepares 4 chapters out of 5, very well for a test. But a major question is asked from the chapter that she left unprepared. Oh! my Everyone knows that a particular train runs in time but the day you reach raincoat. well in time it is late! You face a lot of situations such as these where you take a chance and it does not go the way you want it to. Can you give some more examples? These are examples where the chances of a certain thing happening or not happening are not equal. The chances of the train being in time or being late are not the same. When you buy a ticket which is wait listed, you do take a chance. You hope that it might get confirmed by the time you travel. We however, consider here certain experiments whose results have an equal chance of occurring. 4.3.1  Getting a result You might have seen that before a cricket match starts, captains of the two teams go out to toss a coin to decide which team will bat first. What are the possible results you get when a coin is tossed? Of course, Head or Tail. Imagine that you are the captain of one team and your friend is the captain of the other team. You toss a coin and ask your friend to make the call. Can you control the result of the toss? Can you get a head if you want one? Or a tail if you want that? No, that is not possible. Such an experiment is called a random experiment. Head or Tail are the two outcomes of this experiment. TRY THESE 1. If you try to start a scooter, what are the possible outcomes? 2. When a die is thrown, what are the six possible outcomes? Reprint 2024-25   3. When you spin the wheel shown, what are the possible outcomes? (Fig 4.6) List them. (Outcome here means the sector at which the pointer stops). Fig 4.6 Fig 4.7 4. You have a bag with five identical balls of different colours and you are to pull out (draw) a ball without looking at it; list the outcomes you would get (Fig 4.7). THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE In throwing a die: • Does the first player have a greater chance of getting a six? • Would the player who played after him have a lesser chance of getting a six? • Suppose the second player got a six. Does it mean that the third player would not have a chance of getting a six? 4.3.2  Equally likely outcomes: A coin is tossed several times and the number of times we get head or tail is noted. Let us look at the result sheet where we keep on increasing the tosses: Number of tosses Tally marks (H) Number of heads Tally mark (T) Number of tails 50 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | 27 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | 23 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | | |  | | | 60 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | 28 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | 32 | | | |  | | | |  | | | | | | |  | | | |  | | | |  | | 70        ... 33        ... 37 80        ... 38        ... 42 90        ... 44        ... 46 100        ... 48        ... 52 Reprint 2024-25   Observe that as you increase the number of tosses more and more, the number of heads and the number of tails come closer and closer to each other. This could also be done with a die, when tossed a large number of times. Number of each of the six outcomes become almost equal  to each other. In such cases, we may say that the different outcomes of the experiment are equally likely. This means that each of the outcomes has the same chance of occurring. 4.3.3  Linking chances to probability Consider the experiment of tossing a coin once. What are the outcomes? There are only two outcomes – Head or Tail. Both the outcomes are equally likely. Likelihood of getting 1 a head is one out of two outcomes, i.e., . In other words, we say that the probability of 2 1 getting a head = . What is the probability of getting a tail? 2 Now take the example of throwing a die marked with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on its faces (one number on one face). If you throw it once, what are the outcomes? The outcomes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Thus, there are six equally likely outcomes. What is the probability of getting the outcome ‘2’? 1 ←   Number of outcomes giving 2 It is 6 ←   Number of equally likely outcomes. What is the probability of getting the number 5? What is the probability of getting the number 7? What is the probability of getting a number 1 through 6? 4.3.4  Outcomes as events Each outcome of an experiment or a collection of outcomes make an event. For example in the experiment of tossing a coin, getting a Head is an event and getting a Tail is also an event. In case of throwing a die, getting each of the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 is an event. Reprint 2024-25   Is getting an even number an event? Since an even number could be 2, 4 or 6, getting an even number is also an event. What will be the probability of getting an even number? 3 ←   Number of outcomes that make the event It is 6 ←   Total number of outcomes of the experiment. Example 3: A bag has 4 red balls and 2 yellow balls. (The balls are identical in all respects other than colour). A ball is drawn from the bag without looking into the bag. What is probability of getting a red ball? Is it more or less than getting a yellow ball? Solution:  There are in all (4 + 2 =) 6 outcomes of  the event. Getting a red ball consists of 4 outcomes. (Why?) 4 2 Therefore, the probability of getting a red ball is = . In the same way the probability 6 3 2 1 of getting a yellow ball = =  (Why?). Therefore, the probability of getting a red ball is 6 3 more than that of getting a yellow ball. TRY THESE Suppose you spin the wheel 1.

Fig 4.8 4.3.5  Chance and probability related to real life We talked about the chance that it rains just on the day when we do not carry a rain coat. What could you say about the chance in terms of probability? Could it be one in 10 1 days during a rainy season? The probability that it rains is then . The probability that it 10 9 does not rain = . (Assuming raining or not raining on a day are equally likely) 10 The use of probability is made in various cases in real life. 1. To find characteristics of a large group by using a small part of the group. For example, during elections ‘an exit poll’ is taken. This involves asking the people whom they have voted for, when they come out after voting at the centres which are chosen off  hand and distributed over the whole area. This gives an idea of chance of winning of each candidate and predictions are made based on it accordingly. Reprint 2024-25   2.
