UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  21 CHAPTER Understanding Quadrilaterals 3 3.1  Introduction You know that the paper is a model for a plane surface. When you join a number of points without lifting a pencil from the paper (and without retracing any portion of the drawing other than single points), you get a plane curve. 3.1.1  Convex and concave polygons A simple closed curve made up of only line segments is called a polygon. Curves that are polygons Curves that are not polygons Here are some convex polygons and some concave polygons. (Fig 3.1) Convex polygons Concave polygons Fig 3.1 Can you find how these types of polygons differ from one another? Polygons that are convex have no portions of their diagonals in their exteriors or any line segment joining any two different points, in the interior of the polygon, lies wholly in the interior of it . Is this true with concave polygons? Study the figures given. Then try to describe in your own words what we mean by a convex polygon and what we mean by a concave polygon. Give two rough sketches of each kind. In our work in this class, we will be dealing with convex polygons only. 3.1.2  Regular and irregular polygons A regular polygon is both ‘equiangular’ and ‘equilateral’. For example, a square has sides of equal length and angles of equal measure. Hence it is a regular polygon. A rectangle is Reprint 2024-25 22  MATHEMATICS equiangular but not equilateral. Is a rectangle a regular polygon? Is an equilateral triangle a regular polygon? Why? Regular polygons Polygons that are not regular [Note: Use of  or  indicates segments of equal length]. In the previous classes, have you come across any quadrilateral that is equilateral but not equiangular? Recall the quadrilateral shapes you saw in earlier classes – Rectangle, Square, Rhombus etc. Is there a triangle that is equilateral but not equiangular? EXERCISE 3.1 1. Given here are some figures.

What is a regular polygon? State the name of a regular polygon of (i) 3 sides (ii) 4 sides (iii) 6 sides Reprint 2024-25 UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  23 3.2  Sum of the Measures of the Exterior Angles of a Polygon On many occasions a knowledge of exterior angles may throw light on the nature of interior angles and sides. DO THIS Draw a polygon on the floor, using a piece of chalk. (In the figure, a pentagon ABCDE is shown) (Fig 3.2). We want to know the total measure of angles, i.e, m∠1 + m∠2 + m∠3 + m∠4 + m∠5. Start at A. Walk along AB . On reaching B, you need to turn through an angle of m∠1, to walk along. BC When you reach at C, you need to turn through an angle of m∠2 to walk along CD . You continue to move in this manner, until you return to side AB. You would have in fact made one complete turn. Fig 3.2 Therefore,  m∠1 + m∠2 + m∠3 + m∠4 + m∠5  = 360°. This is true whatever be the number of sides of the polygon. Therefore, the sum of the measures of the external angles of any polygon is 360°. Example 1: Find measure x in Fig 3.3. Solution: x + 90° + 50° + 110° = 360°      (Why?) x + 250° = 360° x = 110° TRY THESE Fig 3.3 Take a regular hexagon Fig 3.4. 1. What is the sum of the measures of its exterior angles x, y, z, p, q, r? 2. Is  x = y = z = p = q = r? Why? 3. What is the measure of each? (i) exterior angle (ii) interior angle 4. Repeat this activity for the cases of (i) a regular octagon (ii) a regular 20-gon Fig 3.4 Example 2: Find the number of sides of a regular polygon whose each exterior angle has a measure of 45°. Solution: Total measure of all exterior angles = 360° Measure of each exterior angle = 45° 360 Therefore, the number of exterior angles =  = 8 45 The polygon has 8 sides. Reprint 2024-25 24  MATHEMATICS EXERCISE 3.2 1. Find x in the following figures. (a) (b) 2. Find the measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon of (i) 9 sides (ii) 15 sides 3. How many sides does a regular polygon have if the measure of an exterior angle is 24°? 4. How many sides does a regular polygon have if each of its interior angles is 165°? 5. (a) Is it possible to have a regular polygon with measure of each exterior angle as 22°? (b) Can it be an interior angle of a regular polygon? Why? 6. (a) What is the minimum interior angle possible for a regular polygon? Why? (b) What is the maximum exterior angle possible for a regular polygon? 3.3  Kinds of Quadrilaterals Based on the nature of the sides or angles of a quadrilateral, it gets special names. 3.3.1  Trapezium Trapezium is a quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides. These are trapeziums These are not trapeziums Study the above figures and discuss with your friends why some of them are trapeziums while some are not. (Note: The arrow marks indicate parallel lines). DO THIS 1. Take identical cut-outs of congruent triangles of sides 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm. Arrange them as shown (Fig 3.5). Fig 3.5 Reprint 2024-25 UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  25 You get a trapezium. (Check it!) Which are the parallel sides here? Should the non-parallel sides be equal? You can get two more trapeziums using the same set of triangles. Find them out and discuss their shapes. 2. Take four set-squares from your and your friend’s instrument boxes. Use different numbers of them to place side-by-side and obtain different trapeziums. If the non-parallel sides of a trapezium are of equal length, we call it an isosceles trapezium. Did you get an isoceles trapezium in any of your investigations given above? 3.3.2  Kite Kite is a special type of a quadrilateral. The sides with the same markings in each figure are equal. For example AB = AD and BC = CD. These are kites These are not kites Study these figures and try to describe what a kite is. Observe that (i) A kite has 4 sides (It is a quadrilateral). (ii) There are exactly two distinct consecutive pairs of sides of equal length. Check whether a square is a kite. DO THIS Show that ∆ABC and Take a thick white sheet. ∆ADC are Fold the paper once. congruent . Draw two line segments of different lengths as shown in Fig 3.6. What do we Cut along the line segments and open up. infer from this? You have the shape of a kite (Fig 3.6). Has the kite any line symmetry? Fig 3.6 Fold both the diagonals of the kite. Use the set-square to check if they cut at right angles. Are the diagonals equal in length? Verify (by paper-folding or measurement) if the diagonals bisect each other. By folding an angle of the kite on its opposite, check for angles of equal measure. Observe the diagonal folds; do they indicate any diagonal being an angle bisector? Share your findings with others and list them. A summary of these results are given elsewhere in the chapter for your reference. Fig 3.7 Reprint 2024-25 26  MATHEMATICS 3.3.3  Parallelogram A parallelogram is a quadrilateral. As the name suggests, it has something to do with parallel lines. AB  DC AD  BC AB  CD LM ON QP  SR AB  ED LO MN QS  PR BC  FE Thes e    a r  e    p  a  r a  l l e  l o  g  r a  m   s                                These are not parallelograms Study these figures and try to describe in your own words what we mean by a parallelogram. Share your observations with your friends. Check whether a rectangle is also a parallelogram. DO THIS Take two different rectangular cardboard strips of different widths (Fig 3.8). Strip 1 Fig 3.8 Strip 2 Place one strip horizontally and draw lines along its edge as drawn in the figure (Fig 3.9). Now place the other strip in a slant position over the lines drawn and use this to draw two more lines Fig 3.9 as shown (Fig 3.10). These four lines enclose a quadrilateral. This is made up of two pairs of parallel lines (Fig 3.11). Fig 3.10 Fig 3.11 Reprint 2024-25 UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  27 It is a parallelogram. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel. 3.3.4  Elements of a parallelogram There are four sides and four angles in a parallelogram. Some of these are equal. There are some terms associated with these elements that you need to remember. Fig 3.12 Given a parallelogram ABCD (Fig 3.12). AB  and DC , are opposite sides. AD  and BC  form another pair of opposite sides. ∠A and ∠C are a pair of opposite angles; another pair of opposite angles would be ∠B and ∠D. AB  and BC  are adjacent sides. This means, one of the sides starts where the other ends. Are BC  and CD  adjacent sides too? Try to find two more pairs of adjacent sides. ∠A and ∠B are adjacent angles. They are at the ends of the same side. ∠B and ∠C are also adjacent. Identify other pairs of adjacent angles of the parallelogram. DO THIS Take cut-outs of two identical parallelograms, say ABCD and A′B′C′D′ (Fig 3.13). Fig 3.13 Here AB  is same as A′B′  except for the name. Similarly the other corresponding sides are equal too. Place A′B′  over DC . Do they coincide? What can you now say about the lengths AB  and DC? Similarly examine the lengths AD  and BC . What do you find? You may also arrive at this result by measuring AB  and DC . Property: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are of equal length. TRY THESE Take two identical set squares with angles 30° – 60° – 90° and place them adjacently to form a parallelogram as shown in Fig 3.14. Does this help you to verify the above property? You can further strengthen this idea through a logical argument also. Consider a parallelogram ABCD (Fig 3.15). Draw any one diagonal, say AC . Fig 3.15 Fig 3.14 Reprint 2024-25 28  MATHEMATICS Looking at the angles, ∠1 = ∠2 and ∠3 = ∠4   (Why?) Since in triangles ABC and ADC,  ∠1 = ∠2,  ∠3 = ∠4 and AC  is common, so, by ASA congruency condition, ∆ ABC ≅ ∆ CDA (How is ASA used here?) This gives AB = DC and BC = AD. Example 3: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram PQRS (Fig 3.16). Solution: In a parallelogram, the opposite sides have same length. Therefore, PQ = SR = 12 cm and QR = PS = 7 cm So, Perimeter = PQ + QR + RS + SP = 12 cm + 7 cm + 12 cm + 7 cm = 38 cm Fig 3.16 3.3.5 Angles of a parallelogram We studied a property of parallelograms concerning the (opposite) sides. What can we say about the angles? DO THIS Let ABCD be a parallelogram (Fig 3.17). Copy it on a tracing sheet. Name this copy as A′B′C′D′. Place A′B′C′D′ on ABCD. Pin them together at the point where the diagonals meet. Rotate the transparent sheet by 180°. The parallelograms still concide; but you now find A′ lying exactly on C and vice-versa; similarly B′ lies on D and vice-versa. Fig 3.17 Does this tell you anything about the measures of the angles A and C? Examine the same for angles B and D. State your findings. Property: The opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure. TRY THESE Take two identical 30° – 60° – 90° set-squares and form a parallelogram as before. Does the figure obtained help you to confirm the above property? You can further justify this idea through logical arguments. If  AC  and BD  are the diagonals of the parallelogram, (Fig 3.18) you find that ∠1 =∠2 and ∠3 = ∠4      (Why?) Fig 3.18 Reprint 2024-25 UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  29 Studying ∆ ABC and ∆ ADC (Fig 3.19) separately, will help you to see that by ASA congruency condition, ∆ ABC ≅ ∆ CDA(How?) Fig 3.19 This shows that ∠B and ∠D have same measure. In the same way you can get m∠A = m ∠C. Alternatively, ∠1 = ∠2 and ∠3 = ∠4, we have, m∠A = ∠1+∠4 = ∠2+∠C  m∠C Example 4: In Fig 3.20, BEST is a parallelogram. Find the values x, y and z. Solution: S is opposite to B. So, x = 100° (opposite angles property) y = 100° (measure of angle corresponding to ∠x) z = 80° (since ∠y, ∠z is a linear pair) We now turn our attention to adjacent angles of a parallelogram. In parallelogram ABCD, (Fig 3.21). Fig 3.20 ∠A and ∠D are supplementary since DC  AB  and with transversal DA , these two angles are interior opposite. ∠A and ∠B are also supplementary. Can you Fig 3.21 say ‘why’? AD  BC  and BA  is a transversal, making ∠A and ∠B interior opposite. Identify two more pairs of supplementary angles from the figure. Property: The adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. Example 5: In a parallelogram RING, (Fig 3.22) if m∠R = 70°, find all the other angles. Solution: Given m∠R = 70° Then m∠N = 70° because ∠R and ∠N are opposite angles of a parallelogram. Since ∠R and ∠I are supplementary, m∠I = 180° – 70° = 110° Fig 3.22 Also, m∠G = 110° since ∠G is opposite to ∠I Thus, m∠R = m∠N = 70° and m∠I = m∠G = 110° Reprint 2024-25 30  MATHEMATICS THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE After showing m∠R = m∠N = 70°, can you find m∠I and m∠G by any other method? 3.3.6 Diagonals of a parallelogram The diagonals of a parallelogram, in general, are not of equal length. (Did you check this in your earlier activity?) However, the diagonals of a parallelogram have an interesting property. DO THIS Take a cut-out of a parallelogram, say, ABCD (Fig 3.23). Let its diagonals AC  and DB  meet at O. Fig 3.23 Find the mid point of AC  by a fold, placing C on A. Is the mid-point same as O? Does this show that diagonal DB  bisects the diagonal AC  at the point O? Discuss it with your friends. Repeat the activity to find where the mid point of  DB  could lie. Property: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other (at the point of their intersection, of course!) To argue and justify this property is not very difficult. From Fig 3.24, applying ASA criterion, it is easy to see that ∆ AOB ≅ ∆ COD    (How is ASA used here?) Fig 3.24 This gives AO = CO and BO = DO Example 6: In Fig 3.25 HELP is a parallelogram. (Lengths are in cms). Given that OE = 4 and HL is 5 more than PE? Find OH. Solution : If OE = 4 then OP also is 4 (Why?) So PE = 8, (Why?) Therefore HL = 8 + 5 = 13 Fig 3.25 1 Hence OH = × 13  = 6.5 (cms) 2 EXERCISE 3.3 1. Given a parallelogram ABCD. Complete each statement along with the definition or property used. (i) AD = ......

(i) (ii) 30 (iii) (iv) (v) 3. Can a quadrilateral ABCD be a parallelogram if (i) ∠D + ∠B = 180°? (ii) AB = DC = 8 cm, AD = 4 cm and BC = 4.4 cm? (iii) ∠A = 70° and ∠C = 65°? 4. Draw a rough figure of a quadrilateral that is not a parallelogram but has exactly two opposite angles of equal measure. 5.

In the above figure both RISK and CLUE are parallelograms. Find the value of x. Reprint 2024-25 32  MATHEMATICS 10. Explain how this figure is a trapezium. Which of its two sides are parallel?

Fig 3.28 3.4  Some Special Parallelograms 3.4.1  Rhombus We obtain a Rhombus (which, you will see, is a parallelogram) as a special case of kite (which is not a a parallelogram). DO THIS Recall the paper-cut kite you made earlier. Kite-cut Rhombus-cut When you cut along ABC and opened up, you got a kite. Here lengths AB and BC were different. If you draw AB = BC, then the kite you obtain is called a rhombus. Note that the sides of rhombus are all of same length; this is not the case with the kite. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with sides of equal length. Since the opposite sides of a rhombus have the same length, it is also a parallelogram. So, a rhombus has all the properties of a parallelogram and also that of a kite. Try to list them out. You can then verify your list with the check list summarised in the book elsewhere. Kite Rhombus Reprint 2024-25 UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  33 The most useful property of a rhombus is that of its diagonals. Property: The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of one another. DO THIS Take a copy of rhombus. By paper-folding verify if the point of intersection is the mid-point of each diagonal. You may also check if they intersect at right angles, using the corner of a set-square. Here is an outline justifying this property using logical steps. ABCD is a rhombus (Fig 3.29). Therefore it is a parallelogram too. Since diagonals bisect each other,      OA = OC  and  OB = OD. We have to show that m∠AOD = m∠COD = 90° It can be seen that by SSS congruency criterion Fig 3.29 ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ COD Since AO = CO (Why?) Therefore, m ∠AOD = m ∠COD AD = CD (Why?) Since ∠AOD and ∠COD are a linear pair, OD = OD m ∠AOD = m ∠COD = 90° Example 7: RICE is a rhombus (Fig 3.30). Find x, y, z. Justify your findings. Solution: x = OE y = OR z = side of the rhombus = OI  (diagonals bisect) = OC (diagonals bisect) = 13 (all sides are equal ) = 5 = 12 Fig 3.30 3.4.2  A rectangle A rectangle is a parallelogram with equal angles (Fig 3.31). What is the full meaning of this definition? Discuss with your friends. If the rectangle is to be equiangular, what could be the measure of each angle? Fig 3.31 Let the measure of each angle be x°. Then 4x° = 360° (Why)? Therefore, x° = 90° Thus each angle of a rectangle is a right angle. So, a rectangle is a parallelogram in which every angle is a right angle. Being a parallelogram, the rectangle has opposite sides of equal length and its diagonals bisect each other. Reprint 2024-25 34  MATHEMATICS In a parallelogram, the diagonals can be of different lengths. (Check this); but surprisingly the rectangle (being a special case) has diagonals of equal length. Property: The diagonals of a rectangle are of equal length. Fig 3.32 Fig 3.33 Fig 3.34 This is easy to justify. If ABCD is a rectangle (Fig 3.38),  then looking at triangles ABC and ABD separately [(Fig 3.33) and (Fig 3.34) respectively], we have ∆ ABC ≅ ∆ ABD This is because AB = AB (Common) BC = AD (Why?) m ∠A = m ∠B = 90° (Why?) The congruency follows by SAS criterion. Thus AC = BD and in a rectangle the diagonals, besides being equal in length bisect each other (Why?) Example 8: RENT is a rectangle (Fig 3.35). Its diagonals meet at O. Find x, if OR = 2x + 4 and OT = 3x + 1. Solution: OT  is half of the diagonal TE , OR  is half of the diagonal RN . Diagonals are equal here. (Why?) So, their halves are also equal. Therefore 3x + 1 = 2x + 4 or x = 3 3.4.3  A square A square is a rectangle with equal sides. Fig 3.35 This means a square has all the properties of a rectangle with an additional requirement that all the sides have equal length. The square, like the rectangle, has diagonals of equal length. BELT is a square, BE = EL = LT = TB In a rectangle, there is no requirement ∠B, ∠E, ∠L, ∠T are right angles. for the diagonals to be perpendicular to BL = ET and BL ⊥ ET . one another, (Check this).  OB = OL and OE = OT. Reprint 2024-25 UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  35 In a square the diagonals. (i) bisect one another (square being a parallelogram) (ii) are of equal length (square being a rectangle) and (iii) are perpendicular to one another. Hence, we get the following property. Property: The diagonals of a square are perpendicular bisectors of each other. DO THIS Take a square sheet, say PQRS (Fig 3.37). Fold along both the diagonals. Are their mid-points the same? Check if the angle at O is 90° by using a set-square. This verifies the property stated above. Fig 3.36 We can justify this also by arguing logically: ABCD is a square whose diagonals meet at O (Fig 3.37). OA = OC   (Since the square is a parallelogram) By SSS congruency condition, we now see that ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ COD    (How?) Therefore, m∠AOD = m∠COD These angles being a linear pair, each is right angle.
