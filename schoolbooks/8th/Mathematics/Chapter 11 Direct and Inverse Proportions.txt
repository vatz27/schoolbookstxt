He uses 300 mL of water, 2 spoons of sugar, 1 spoon of tea leaves and 50 mL of milk. How much quantity of each item will he need, if he has to make tea for five persons? If two students take 20 minutes to arrange chairs for an assembly, then how much time would five students take to do the same job? We come across many such situations in our day-to-day life, where we need to see variation in one quantity bringing in variation in the other quantity. For example: (i) If the number of articles purchased increases, the total cost also increases. (ii) More the money deposited in a bank, more is the interest earned. (iii) As the speed of a vehicle increases, the time taken to cover the same distance decreases. (iv) For a given job, more the number of workers, less will be the time taken to complete the work. Observe that change in one quantity leads to change in the other quantity. Write five more such situations where change in one quantity leads to change in another quantity. How do we find out the quantity of each item needed by Mohan? Or, the time five students take to complete the job? To answer such questions, we now study some concepts of variation. 11.2 Direct Proportion If the cost of 1 kg of sugar is   36, then what would be the cost of 3 kg sugar? It is  108. Reprint 2024-25   Similarly, we can find the cost of 5 kg or 8 kg of sugar. Study the following table. Observe that as weight of sugar increases, cost also increases in such a manner that their ratio remains constant. Take one more example. Suppose a car uses 4 litres of petrol to travel a distance of 60 km. How far will it travel using 12 litres? The answer is 180 km. How did we calculate it? Since petrol consumed in the second instance is 12 litres, i.e., three times of 4 litres, the distance travelled will also be three times of 60 km. In other words, when the petrol consumption becomes three-fold, the distance travelled is also three fold the previous one. Let the consumption of petrol be x litres and the corresponding distance travelled be y km . Now, complete the following table: Petrol in litres (x) 4 8 12 15 20 25 Distance in km (y) 60 ... 180 ... ... ... We find that as the value of x increases, value of y also increases in such a way that the x 1 ratio  does not change; it remains constant (say k). In this case, it is  (check it!). y 15 x We say that x and y are in direct proportion, if  = k  or x = ky. y 4 12 In this example, = , where 4 and 12 are the quantities of petrol consumed in 60 180 litres (x) and 60 and 180 are the distances (y) in km. So when x and y are in direct x x proportion, we can write 1 = 2 . [y , y  are values of y corresponding to the values x , 1 2 1 y1 y2 x  of x respectively] 2 The consumption of petrol and the distance travelled by a car is a case of direct proportion. Similarly, the total amount spent and the number of articles purchased is also an example of direct proportion.

Check whether Mohan [in the initial example] will 1 take 750 mL of water, 5 spoons of sugar, 2  spoons of tea leaves and 125 mL of milk to prepare tea for 2 five persons! Let us try to understand further the concept of direct proportion through the following activities. DO THIS (i) • Take a clock and fix its minute hand at 12. • Record the angle turned through by the minute hand from its original position and the time that has passed, in the following table: Time Passed (T) (T ) (T ) (T ) (T ) 1 2 3 4 (in minutes) 15 30 45 60 Angle turned (A) (A ) (A ) (A ) (A ) 1 2 3 4 (in degree) 90 ... ... ... T ... ... ... ... A What do you observe about T and A? Do they increase together? T Is   same every time? A Is the angle turned through by the minute hand directly proportional to the time that has passed? Yes! From the above table, you can also see T  : T  = A  : A  , because 1 2 1 2 T  : T  = 15 : 30 = 1:2 1 2 A  : A  = 90 : 180 = 1:2 1 2 Check if T  : T  =  A  : A   and  T  : T   = A  : A 2 3 2 3 3 4 3 4 You can repeat this activity by choosing your own time interval. (ii) Ask your friend to fill the following table and find the ratio of his age to the corresponding age of his mother. Age Present Age five years ago age after five years Friend’s age (F) Mother’s age (M) F M What do you observe? F Do F and M increase (or decrease) together? Is  same every time? No! M You can repeat this activity with other friends and write down your observations. Reprint 2024-25   Thus, variables increasing (or decreasing) together need not always be in direct proportion. For example: (i) physical changes in human beings occur with time but not necessarily in a predetermined ratio. (ii) changes in weight and height among individuals are not in any known proportion and (iii)  there is no direct relationship or ratio between the height of a tree and the number of leaves growing on its branches.

Would there be a similar relationship for compound interest? Why? Let us consider some solved examples where we would use the concept of direct proportion. Example 1: The cost of 5 metres of a particular quality of cloth is  210. Tabulate the cost of 2, 4, 10 and 13 metres of cloth of the same type.

Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. Solution: Let the height of the tree be x metres. We form a table as shown below: height of the object (in metres) 14 x length of the shadow (in metres) 10 15 Note that more the height of an object, the more would be the length of its shadow. x1 x2 Hence, this is a case of direct proportion. That is, = y1 y2 14 x We have  =    (Why?) 10 15 14 or × 15  = x 10 14 × 3 or  = x 2 So 21 = x Thus, height of the tree is 21 metres. x Alternately, we can write 1 x x y = 2   as 1 = 1 y1 y2 x2 y2 Reprint 2024-25   so x  : x  = y  : y 1 2 1 2 or 14 : x = 10 : 15 Therefore, 10 × x = 15 × 14 15 × 14 or x =  = 21 10 Example 3: If the weight of 12 sheets of thick paper is 40 grams, how many sheets of 1 the same paper would weigh 2  kilograms? 2 Solution: 1 Let the number of sheets which weigh 2  kg be x. We put the above information in 2 the form of a table as shown below: Number of sheets 12 x Weight of sheets (in grams) 40 2500 More the number of sheets, the more would their weight be. So, the number of sheets and their weights 1 kilogram = 1000 grams are directly proportional to each other. 1 2  kilograms = 2500 grams 12 x 2 So,  = 40 2500 12 × 2500 or  = x 40 or 750 = x Thus, the required number of sheets of paper = 750. Alternate method: x Two quantities x and y which vary in direct proportion have the relation x = ky or = k y number of sheets 12 3 Here, k =  = = weight of sheets in grams 40 10 1 Now x is the number of sheets of the paper which weigh 2  kg [2500 g]. 2 3 Using the relation x = ky,  x =  × 2500 = 750 10 1 Thus, 750 sheets of paper would weigh 2  kg. 2 Example 4: A train is moving at a uniform speed of 75 km/hour. (i) How far will it travel in 20 minutes? (ii)  Find the time required to cover a distance of 250 km. Solution: Let the distance travelled (in km)  in 20 minutes be x and time taken (in minutes) to cover 250 km be y. Distance travelled (in km) 75 x 250 1 hour = 60 minutes Time taken (in minutes) 60 20 y Reprint 2024-25   Since the speed is uniform, therefore, the distance covered would be directly proportional to time. 75 x (i) We have = 60 20 75 or × 20  = x 60 or x = 25 So, the train will cover a distance of 25 km in 20 minutes. 75 250 (ii) Also, = 60 y 250 × 60 or y =  = 200 minutes or 3 hours  20 minutes. 75 Therefore, 3 hours 20 minutes will be required to cover a distance of 250 kilometres. x 250 Alternatively, when x is known, then one can determine y from the relation =  . 20 y You know that a map is a miniature representation of a very large region. A scale is usually given at the bottom of the map. The scale shows a relationship between actual length and the length represented on the map. The scale of  the map is thus the ratio of the distance between two points on the map to the actual distance between two points on the large region. For example, if 1 cm on the map represents 8 km of actual distance [i.e., the scale is 1 cm :  8 km or 1 : 800,000] then 2 cm on the same map will represent 16 km. Hence, we can say that scale of a map is based on the concept of direct proportion. Example 5: The scale of a map is given as 1:30000000. Two cities are 4 cm apart on the map. Find the actual distance between them. Solution: Let the map distance be x cm and actual distance be y cm, then 1:30000000 = x : y 1 x or 7  = 3 × 10 y 1 4 Since x = 4    so,       7  = 3 × 10 y or y = 4 × 3 × 107 = 12 × 107 cm = 1200 km. Thus, two cities, which are 4 cm apart on the map, are actually 1200 km away from each other. DO THIS Take a map of your State. Note the scale used there. Using a ruler, measure the “map distance” between any two cities. Calculate the actual distance between them. Reprint 2024-25   EXERCISE 11.1 1.

Choose a scale and make a map of your classroom, showing windows, doors, blackboard etc. (An example is given here). THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE Take a few problems discussed so far under ‘direct variation’. Do you think that they can be solved by ‘unitary method’? 11.3 Inverse Proportion Two quantities may change in such a manner that if one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases and vice versa. For example, as the number of workers increases, time taken to finish the job decreases. Similarly, if we increase the speed, the time taken to cover a given distance decreases. To understand this, let us look into the following situation. Zaheeda can go to her school in four different ways. She can walk, run, cycle or go by car. Study the following table. Reprint 2024-25   Observe that as the speed increases, time taken to cover the same distance decreases. As Zaheeda doubles her speed by running, time reduces to half. As she increases her speed to three  Multiplicative inverse of a number times by cycling, time decreases to one third. 1 is its reciprocal. Thus,  is the Similarly, as she increases her speed to 15 times, 2 time decreases to one fifteenth. (Or, in other words inverse of 2 and vice versa. (Note the ratio by which time decreases is inverse of the 1 1 that 2 × = × 2 = 1). ratio by which the corresponding speed increases). 2 2 Can we say that speed and time change inversely in proportion? Let us consider another example. A school wants to spend  6000 on mathematics textbooks. How many books could be bought at  40 each? Clearly 150 books can be bought. If the price of a textbook is more than  40, then the number of books which could be purchased with the same amount of money would be less than 150. Observe the following table. Price of each book (in ) 40 50 60 75 80 100 Number of books that 150 120 100 80 75 60 can be bought What do you observe? You will appreciate that as the price of the books increases, the number of books that can be bought, keeping the fund constant, will decrease. Ratio by which the price of books increases when going from 40 to 50 is 4 : 5, and the ratio by which the corresponding number of books decreases from 150 to 120 is 5 : 4. This means that the two ratios are inverses of each other. Notice that the product of the corresponding values of the two quantities is constant; that is, 40 × 150 = 50 × 120 = 6000. If we represent the price of one book as x and the number of books bought as y, then as x increases y decreases and vice-versa. It is important to note that the product xy remains constant. We say that x varies inversely with y and y varies inversely with x. Thus two quantities x and y are said to vary in inverse proportion, if there exists a relation of the type xy = k between them, k being a constant. If y , y  are the values of y 1 2 x y corresponding to the values x , x  of x respectively then x y  = x y  (= k), or 1 = 2 . 1 2 1 1 2 2 x2 y1 We say that x and y are in inverse proportion. Hence, in this example, cost of a book and number of books purchased in a fixed amount are inversely proportional. Similarly, speed of a vehicle and the time taken to cover a fixed distance changes in inverse proportion. Think of more such examples of pairs of quantities that vary in inverse proportion. You may now have a look at the furniture – arranging problem, stated in the introductory part of this chapter. Here is an activity for better understanding of the inverse proportion.

Solution: Let the desired time to fill the tank be x minutes. Thus, we have the following table. Number of pipes 6 5 Time (in minutes) 80 x Lesser the number of pipes, more will be the time required by it to fill the tank. So, this is a case of inverse proportion. Hence, 80 × 6 = x × 5 [x  y  = x y ] 1 1 2 2 80 × 6 or = x 5 or x = 96 Thus, time taken to fill the tank by 5 pipes  is 96 minutes or 1 hour 36 minutes.

Solution:  Suppose the provisions last for y days when the number of students is 125. We have the following table. Number of students 100 125 Number of days 20 y Note that more the number of students, the sooner would the provisions exhaust. Therefore, this is a case of inverse proportion. So, 100 × 20 = 125 × y 100 × 20 or  = y    or 16 = y 125 Thus, the provisions will last for 16 days, if 25 more students join the hostel. x y  = x  y      as    1 y Alternately, we can write x = 2 . 1 1 2 2 x2 y1 That is, x  : x  = y  : y 1 2 2 1 or 100 : 125 = y : 20 100 × 20 or y = = 16 125 Example 9: If 15 workers can build a wall in 48 hours, how many workers will be required to do the same work in 30 hours?
