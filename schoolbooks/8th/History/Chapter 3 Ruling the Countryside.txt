3 Ruling the Countryside Fig. 1 – Robert Clive accepting  the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa from the Mughal ruler in 1765 The Company Becomes the Diwan On 12 August 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive’s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive’s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. As Diwan, the Company became the chief  f inancial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. Reprint 2024-25 chap 1-4.indd   26 4/22/2022   2:49:47 PM Over the years, the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. Revenue for the Company The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years, the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1765, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. Fig. 2 – A weekly market Soon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep in Murshidabad in Bengal crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being Peasants and artisans forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants from rural areas regularly were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. came to these weekly Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation markets (haats) to sell showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770, a terrible famine killed their goods and buy what they needed. These markets ten million people in Bengal.

Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount Fig. 3 – Charles Cornwallis to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be Cornwallis was the Governor- General of Bengal when the increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure Permanent Settlement was a regular flow of revenue into the Company’s coffers and introduced. at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state Source 1 would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from Colebrook on increased production from the land. Bengal ryots The problem In many vi l lages of The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems.

A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century, many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? In the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt Fig. 4 – Thomas Munro, Governor that the village was an important social institution of Madras (1819–26) in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each  village (mahal) had to pay. This demand  was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. The Munro system In the British territories in the South, there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. Read and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots ) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British RULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          29 Reprint 2024-25 chap 1-4.indd   29 4/22/2022   2:49:49 PM Activity should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge.

Peasants were What would you write? unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. Crops for Europe The British also realised that the countryside could not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century, the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. Does colour have a history? Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Fig. 5 – A kalamkari print, Fig. 6 – A Morris cotton print, late- Britain.

Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. Why the demand for Indian indigo? The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century, Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad Plantation – A large producers in Europe pressurised their governments to farm operated by a ban the import of indigo. planter employing Cloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye.

The French began cultivating indigo production of coffee, in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese sugarcane, tobacco, in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in tea and cotton. Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. By the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789, the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? Britain turns to India Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. RULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          31 Reprint 2024-25 chap 1-4.indd   31 4/22/2022   2:49:53 PM From the last decades of the eighteenth century, ind igo  cu l t i va t i on  in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788, only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. As the indigo trade grew, commercial agents a n d  o f f i c i a l s  o f  t h e Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company of ficials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by Fig. 7 – The Slave Revolt in St Domingue, August 1791,  the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and painting by January Scuhodolski Englishmen came to India and became planters.

The problem with nij cultivation The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land Slave – A person who is from?

Nor could supplies be easily got from the In Bengal the British peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy standardised it to about on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the one-third of an acre. indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation – the ryoti system. Indigo on the land of ryots Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. Fig. 8 – Workers harvesting indigo in early-nineteenth-century Bengal.

Fermenting Vat Beater Vat Fig. 10 – An indigo factory located near indigo fields, painting by William Simpson, 1863 The indigo villages were usually around indigo factories owned by planters. After harvest, the indigo plant was taken to the vats in the indigo factory. Three or four vats were needed to manufacture the dye. Each vat had a separate function. The leaves stripped off the indigo plant were first soaked in warm water in a vat (known as the fermenting or steeper vat) for several hours. When the plants fermented, the liquid began to boil and bubble. Now the rotten leaves were taken out and the liquid drained into another vat that was placed just below the first vat. In the second vat (known as the beater vat), the solution was continuously stirred and beaten with paddles. When the liquid Fig. 11 – Women usually gradually turned green and then blue, lime water was added to carried the indigo plant to               the vat.

Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. Source 2 The “Blue Rebellion” and After  A song from an In March 1859, thousands of ryots in Bengal refused indigo-producing to grow indigo.

The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. As the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. Source 3 “I would rather beg than sow indigo” Hadji Mulla, an indigo cultivator of Chandpore, Thana Hardi, was interviewed by the members of the Indigo Commission on Tuesday, 5 June 1860.

When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there.
