6 Civilising the “Native”, Educating the Nation In the earlier chapters, you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter, we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to “civilise the natives”, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians Linguist – Someone to be educated, “civilised”, and made into what the British who knows and believed were “good subjects”? The British could find no simple studies several answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for languages many decades. How the British saw Education Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry, we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. The tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and Fig. 1 – William Jones learning Persian Reprint 2024-25 Chap 6.indd   65 8/31/2022   5:00:41 PM poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. Jones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. Jones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India, it was necessary to discover the sacred Fig. 2 – Henry Thomas and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. Colebrooke For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws He was a scholar of Sanskrit of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of and ancient sacred writings of Hinduism. these texts could form the basis of future development in India. So Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering  ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process, the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. Influenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the “natives”; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. With this object in view, a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian Madrasa – An Arabic and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established word for a place of in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient learning; any type of Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration school or college of the country. 66 OUR PASTS – III Reprint 2024-25 Chap 6.indd   66 4/21/2022   12:18:02 PM Fig. 3 – Monument to Warren Hastings, by Richard Westmacott, 1830, now in Victoria Memorial in Calcutta This image represents how Orientalists thought of British power in India. You will notice that the majestic figure of Hastings, an enthusiastic supporter of the Orientalists, is placed between the standing figure of a pandit on one side and a seated munshi on the other side. Hastings and other Orientalists needed Indian scholars to teach them the “vernacular” languages, tell them about local customs and laws, and help  them translate and interpret ancient texts. Hastings took the initiative to set up the Calcutta Madrasa, and believed that the ancient customs of the country and Oriental learning ought to be the basis of British rule in India. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. Orientalists – Those with “Grave errors of the East” a scholarly knowledge of From the early nineteenth century, many British officials the language and culture began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They of Asia said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious Munshi – A person who and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong can read, write and teach on the part of the British to spend so much effort in Persian encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. Vernacular – A term James Mill was one of those who attacked the generally used to refer to Orientalists.

One of the most outspoken and influential language of the imperial of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington masters. Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced.

The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. Until 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. Over the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support Fig. 6 – William Carey missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong was a Scottish missionary             attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas who helped establish the Serampore Mission might enrage “native” opinion.

Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre- British times? Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? The report of William Adam In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the Fig. 8 – A village pathshala progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam This is a painting by a Dutch produced is interesting. painter, Francois Solvyn, Adam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas who came to India in the late eighteenth century. He tried to in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with depict the everyday life of people no more than 20 students each. But the total number of in his paintings. children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable – over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). The system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places, classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru’s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. Adam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study.

They urged the British to open more some moderately remunerative schools, colleges and universities, and spend more employment after leaving their money on education. You will read about some of schools. these efforts in Chapter 8. There were other Indians, 72 OUR PASTS – III Reprint 2024-25 Chap 6.indd   72 4/21/2022   12:18:14 PM however, who reacted against Western education. Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore were two such individuals. Let us look at what they had to say. “English education has enslaved us” Mahatma Gandhi argued that colonial education created a sense of inferiority in the minds of Indians. It made them see Western civilisation as superior, and destroyed the pride they had in their own culture. There was poison in this education, said Mahatma Gandhi, it was sinful, it enslaved Indians, it cast an evil spell on them. Charmed by the West, appreciating everything that came from the West, Indians educated in these institutions began admiring British rule. Mahatma Gandhi wanted an education that could help Indians recover their sense of dignity and self-respect. During the national movement, he urged students to leave educational institutions in order to show to the British that Indians were no longer willing to be enslaved. Mahatma Gandhi strongly felt that Indian languages ought to be the medium of teaching. Education in English crippled Indians, distanced them from their own social surroundings, and made them “strangers in their own lands”. Speaking a foreign tongue, despising local culture, the English educated did not know how to relate to Fig. 10 – Mahatma Gandhi along the masses. with Kasturba Gandhi sitting with Western education, Mahatma Gandhi said, focused Rabindranath Tagore and a group of girls at Santiniketan, 1940 on reading and writing rather than oral knowledge; it valued textbooks rather than lived experience and practical knowledge. He argued that education ought to develop a person’s mind and soul. Literacy – or simply learning to read and write – by itself did not count as education. People had to work with their hands, learn a craft, and know how different things operated.  This would develop their mind and their  capacity  to understand. CIVILISING THE “NATIVE”, EDUCATING THE NATION         73 Reprint 2024-25 Chap 6.indd   73 4/21/2022   12:18:16 PM Source 3 “Literacy in itself is not education” Mahatma Gandhi wrote: By education I mean an all-round drawing out of the best in child and man – body, mind and spirit. Literacy is not the end of education nor even the beginning. It is only one of the means whereby man and woman can be educated. Literacy in itself is not education. I would therefore begin the child’s education by teaching it a useful handicraft and enabling it to produce from the moment it begins its training … I hold that the highest development of the mind and the soul is possible under such a system of education. Only every handicraft has to be taught not merely mechanically as is done today but scientifically, i.e. the child should know the why and the wherefore of every process. The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, Vol. 72, p. 79 As nationalist sentiments spread, other thinkers also began thinking of a system of national education which would be radically different from that set up by the British. Tagore’s “abode of peace” Many of you may have heard of Santiniketan. Do you know why it was established and by whom? Fig. 11 – A class in progress in Santiniketan in the 1930s Rabindranath Tagore started the institution in 1901. Notice	the	surroundings	–	the	 As a child, Tagore hated going to school. He found it trees and the open spaces.  suffocating and oppressive. The school appeared like a prison, for he could never do what he felt like doing. So while other children listened to the teacher, Tagore’s mind would wander away. The experience of his schooldays in Calcutta shaped Tagore’s ideas of education. On growing up, he wanted to set up a school where the child was happy, where she could be free and creative, where she was able to explore her own thoughts and desires. Tagore felt 74	 OUR	PASTS	–	III Reprint 2024-25 Chap 6.indd   74 4/22/2022   11:56:58 AM that childhood ought to be a time of self-learning, outside the rigid and restricting discipline of the schooling system set up by the British. Teachers had to be imaginative, understand the child, and help the child develop her curiosity. According to Tagore, the existing schools killed the natural desire of the child to be creative, her sense of wonder. Tagore was of the view that creative learning could be encouraged only within a natural environment. So he chose to set up his school 100 kilometres away from Calcutta, in a rural setting. He saw it as an abode of peace (santiniketan), where living in harmony with nature, children could cultivate their natural creativity. In many senses, Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi thought about education in similar ways. There were, however, differences too. Gandhiji was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship of machines and technology. Tagore wanted to combine elements of modern Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within Indian tradition. He emphasised the need to teach science and technology at Santiniketan, along with art, music and dance. Many individuals and thinkers were thus thinking about the way a national educational system could be fashioned. Some wanted changes within the system set up by the British, and felt that the system could be extended so as to include wider sections of people. Others urged that alternative systems be created so that people were educated into a culture that was truly national. Who was to define what was truly national? The debate about what this “national education” ought to be continued till after independence.
