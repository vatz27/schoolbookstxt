Resources Mona and Raju were helping Amma to clean their house. “Look at all these things…. clothes, utensils, foodgrains, combs, this bottle of honey, books…..Each of these has a use,” said Mona. “That is why they are important,” said Amma. “These are resources…..”. “What is a resource?” was Raju’s question to Amma. “Anything that can be used Let’s do to satisfy a need is a resource”, replied amma. “Look around List out five resources you use you and observe, you will be able to identify many types of in your home and resources. The water you drink when you are thirsty, the five you use in electricity you use in your house, the rickshaw you use to your classroom. get home from school, the textbook you use to study are all resources. Your father has prepared a tasty snack for you. The fresh vegetables he has used are also a resource”. Water, electricity, rickshaw, vegetable and textbook have something in common. They have all been used by you, so they have utility. Utility or usability is what makes an object or substance a resource. “How does something become a resource?” Raju now wanted to know. Amma told the children that things become resources only when they have a value. “Its use or utility gives it a value. All resources have some value.” said Amma. Value means worth. Some resources have economic value, some do not. For example, metals may have an Glossary economic value, a beautiful landscape may not.

Types of ResouRces Resources are generally classified into natural, human made and human. Natural Resources Amma’s List Resources that are drawn from Nature and used without Cotton cloth much modification are called natural resources. The Iron ore air we breathe, the water in our rivers and lakes, the Intelligence soils, minerals are all natural resources. Many of these resources are free gifts of nature and can be used directly. Medicinal plants In some cases tools and technology may be needed to Medical knowledge use a natural resource in the best possible way. Coal deposits Natural resources can be broadly categorised into Beautiful scenery renewable and non-renewable resources. Agricultural land Renewable resources are those which get renewed Clean environment or replenished quickly.

But shortage and drying up of natural Grandmother’s water sources is a major problem in many parts of the home remedies world today. Affection from Non-renewable resources are those which have a friends and family limited stock. Once the stocks are exhausted it may take thousands of years to be renewed or replenished. Since this period is much more than human life spans, 2 ResouRces and development 2024-25 Chapter-1.indd   2 8/17/2022   11:34:41 AM such resources are considered non-renewable. Coal, petroleum and natural gas are some examples. Glossary The distribution of natural resources depends Stock of Resource It is the amount of upon number of physical factors like terrain, climate resources available and altitude. The distribution of resources is unequal for use. because these factors differ so much over the earth. Human Made Resources Sometimes, natural substances become resources only Let’s do when their original form has been changed. Iron ore Think of a few was not a resource until people learnt to extract iron renewable resources from it. People use natural resources to make buildings, and mention how bridges, roads, machinery and vehicles, which are their stock may get known as human made resources. Technology is also affected by overuse. a human made resource. “So people like us use natural resources to make human made resources,” said Mona nodding in understanding. Let’s do “Yes,” said Raju. Make a list of Human Resources five human made resources that you People can make the best use of nature to create more can observe around resources when they have the knowledge, skill and the you. “Crops ruined due to that’s it! drought”.

Education and health help in making people a valuable resource. Improving the quality of people’s skills so that they are able to create more resources is known as human resource development. conseRving ResouRces Mona had a nightmare. She dreamt that all the water on the earth had dried up and all the trees cut down. There was no shade and nothing to eat or drink. People were suffering and roaming around desperately looking for food and shade. She told her mother about the dream. “Amma can this really happen?” she asked. Glossary “Yes,” Amma replied. “If we are not careful then even Sustainable renewable resources can become very scarce and the Development Carefully utilising non-renewable ones can definitely get exhausted”. “What resources so that can we do about it,” Raju asked. “Lots,” replied Amma. besides meeting Using resources carefully and giving them time to get the requirements renewed is called resource conservation. Balancing of the present, also takes care of future the need to use resources and also conserve them for generations. the future is called sustainable development. There are many ways of conserving resources. Each person can contribute by reducing consumption, recycling and reusing thing. Ultimately it makes a difference because all our lives are linked. That evening the children and their friends made packets and shopping bags out of old newspapers, discarded clothes and baskets from bamboo sticks. “We will give a few to every family we know,” said Mona. “After all it is for a very good cause,” said Mustafa, “To save our resources and to keep our earth alive”. “I am going to be very careful not to waste paper,” said Jessy. “Many trees are cut down to make paper,” she explained. “I will see that electricity is not wasted in my house,” shouted Mustafa. “Electricity comes from water and coal.” 4 ResouRces and development 2024-25 Chapter-1.indd   4 8/17/2022   11:34:44 AM “I will make sure that water is not wasted at home,” Some Principles of said Asha. “Every drop of water is precious”  Sustainable Development “Together we can make a difference!” chorused the Respect and care for all children. forms of life Improve the quality of These are some of the things Mona, Raju and their human life friends did.
