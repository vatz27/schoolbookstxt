In the light of the availability of Activity 3.1 various resources in nature, natural resources can be broadly classified Make a list of various materials used into two kinds: by us in daily life and classify them as natural and man-made. (i) Inexhaustible Natural Resources: These resources are present in unlimited Natural Man-made quantity in nature and are not likely to be exhausted by human activities. Examples are: sunlight, air. (ii) Exhaustible Natural Resources: The amount of these resources in nature is limited. They can be exhausted by human activities. Examples of these resources are forests, wildlife, minerals, coal, petroleum, natural gas etc. Activity 3.2 (It is a group activity) Does this list include air, water, soil and minerals?

Many useful substances are obtained from petroleum and natural gas. These are termed as ‘Petrochemicals’. These are used in the manufacture of detergents, fibres (polyester, nylon, acrylic etc.), polythene and other man-made plastics. Hydrogen gas obtained from natural gas, is used in the production of fertilisers (urea). Due to its great commercial importance, petroleum is also called ‘black gold’. 3.3 Natural Gas Fig. 3.5: A petroleum refinery Natural gas is a very important fossil fuel because it is easy to transport separating the various constituents/ through pipes. Natural gas is stored fractions of petroleum is known as under high pressure as compressed refining. It is carried out in a petroleum natural gas (CNG).
