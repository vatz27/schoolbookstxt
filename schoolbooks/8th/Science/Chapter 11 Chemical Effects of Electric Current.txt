This completes the circuit of the tester and the bulb should glow.  However, if the bulb does not glow, it means that the tester is not working. Can you think of the possible reasons? Is it possible that the connections are loose? Or, the bulb is fused? Or, your cells are used up? Check that all the connections are tight. If they are, then replace the bulb with another bulb. Now test if the tester is working or not. If it is still not Fig. 11.2 : Testing conduction of electricity in working then replace the cells with lemon juice or vinegar fresh cells.

Do you recall that electric current produces a magnetic effect? What happens to a compass needle kept nearby when current flows in a wire? Even if the current is small, the deflection of the magnetic needle can be seen. Can we make a tester using the magnetic effect of currents? Let us find out in Activity 11.3.

Recall the other wire (Fig. 11.6). definition of a chemical change that you learnt in Class VII. In 1800, a British chemist, William Nicholson (1753–1815), had shown that if electrodes were immersed in water, and a current was passed, bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen were produced.

Note down the In both these cases, a metal has a terminal of the battery with which coating of another metal. Do you wonder this electrode is connected. how a layer of one metal can be deposited on top of another? Well, let us try doing it ourselves. After doing the electroplating activity, Paheli interchanged Activity 11.7 the electrodes and repeated We will need copper sulphate and the activity. What do you think she would observe this time? two copper plates of size around 10 cm × 4 cm. Take 250 mL of distilled water in a clean and dry When electric current is passed beaker.

The free copper sulphate solution to make it more gets drawn to the electrode connected conducting. Clean copper plates with to the negative terminal of the battery sand paper.

Connect the about the loss of copper from the copper plates to the terminals of a solution? battery and immerse them in copper From the other electrode, a copper sulphate solution (Fig. 11.7). plate, an equal amount of copper gets dissolved in the solution. Thus, the 144 SCIENCE 2024-25 loss of copper from the solution is restored and the process continues. This means that copper gets transferred from one electrode to the other. Boojho could get only one copper plate. So he performed Activity 11.7 by connecting a carbon rod in place of the copper plate which was connected to the negative terminal of the battery. He succeeded in obtaining a coating of copper on carbon rod. The process of depositing a layer of any desired metal on another material by means of electricity is called Fig. 11.8 : Some electroplated objects electroplating.

LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are available in many colours such as red, green, yellow, blue, white and are increasingly being used for many applications, for example in traffic signal lights. LEDs are increasingly being used for lighting. A cluster of white LEDs grouped together forms a LED light source. LED light sources consume less electricity and have longer lifetime  than light bulbs and fluorescent tubes. Hence these are gradually becoming the preferred lighting source.
