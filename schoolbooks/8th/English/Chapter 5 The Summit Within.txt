Before you read Major H.P.S. Ahluwalia was a member of the first successful Indian expedition to Mount Everest in 1965. How did he feel when he stood on the highest point in the world? Let us hear his story in his words — climbing the summit and, then, the more difficult task of climbing the summit within. surged: arose Of all the emotions which surged through me as I stood suddenly and on the summit of Everest, looking over miles of intensely panorama below us, the dominant one I think was panorama: humility. The physical in me seemed to say, ‘Thank view of a wide area God, it’s all over!” However, instead of being jubilant, there was a tinge of sadness. Was it because I had already jubilant: very happy done the ‘ultimate’ in climbing and there would be because of nothing higher to climb and all roads hereafter would success lead down? tinge: By climbing the summit of Everest you are trace/shade overwhelmed by a deep sense of joy and thankfulness. It is a joy which lasts a lifetime. The experience changes you completely. The man who has been to the mountains is never the same again. As I look back at life after climbing Everest I cannot help remarking about the other summit — the summit of the mind — no less formidable and no easier to climb. 72 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 Even when getting down from the summit, once the physical exhaustion had gone, I began asking myself exhaustion: the question why I had climbed Everest. Why did the fatigue; act of reaching the summit have such a hold on my tiredness imagination? It was already a thing of the past, something done yesterday. With every passing day, it would become more remote. And then what would remain? Would my memories fade slowly away? All these thoughts led me to question myself as to why people climb mountains. It is not easy to answer the question. The simplest answer would be, as others have said, “Because it is there.” It presents great difficulties. Man takes delight in overcoming obstacles. The obstacles in climbing a mountain are physical. A climb to a summit means endurance, persistence and will power. The demonstration of these physical qualities is no doubt exhilarating, as it was for me also. I have a more personal answer to the question. From exhilarating: my childhood I have been attracted by mountains. I very exciting had been miserable, lost, when away from mountains, communion: in the plains. Mountains are nature at its best. Their state or feeling beauty and majesty pose a great challenge, and like many, I believe that mountains are a means of communion with God. Once having granted this, the question remains: Why Everest? Because it is the highest, the mightiest and of close relahas defied many previous attempts. It takes the last tionship ounce of one’s energy. It is a brutal struggle with rock defied: and ice. Once taken up, it cannot be given up halfway frustrated; even when one’s life is at stake. The passage back is as resisted difficult as the passage onwards. And then, when the summit is climbed, there is the exhilaration, the joy of having done something, the sense of a battle fought and won. There is a feeling of victory and of happiness. Glimpsing a peak in the distance, I get transported to another world. I experience a change within myself The Summit Within 73 Reprint 2024-25 mystical: which can only be called mystical. By its beauty, spiritual aloofness, might, ruggedness, and the difficulties encountered on the way, the peak draws me to it — as Everest did. It is a challenge that is difficult to resist. Looking back I find that I have not yet fully explained why I climbed Everest. It is like answering a question why you breathe. Why do you help your neighbour? Why do you want to do good acts? There is no final answer possible. And then there is the fact that Everest is not just a physical climb. The man who has been to the mountain-top becomes conscious in a special manner of his own smallness in this large universe. The physical conquest of a mountain is only one part of the achievement. There is more to it than that. It is followed by a sense of fulfilment. There is the satisfaction of a deep urge to rise above one’s surroundings. It is the eternal love for adventure in man. The experience is not merely physical. It is emotional. It is spiritual. Consider a typical climb, towards the summit on the last heights. You are sharing a rope with another firm in: climber. You firm in. He cuts the steps in the hard ice. make yourself Then he belays and you inch your way up. The climb is firm grim. You strain every nerve as you take every step. belays: Famous climbers have left records of the help given by fixes a rope others. They have also recorded how they needed just that help. Else they might have given up. Breathing is difficult. You curse yourself for having let yourself in for ascent: this. You wonder why you ever undertook the ascent. climb There are moments when you feel like going back. It would be sheer relief to go down, instead of up. But almost at once you snap out of that mood. There is something in you that does not let you give up the 74 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 struggle. And you go on. Your companion keeps up with you. Just another fifty feet. Or a hundred, maybe. You ask yourself: Is there no end? You look at your companion and he looks at you. You draw inspiration from each other. And then, without first being aware of it, you are at the summit. Looking round from the summit you tell yourself that it was worthwhile. Other silvery peaks appear through the clouds. If you are lucky the sun may be on them. The surrounding peaks look like a jewelled necklace around the neck of your summit. Below, you see vast valleys sloping into the distance. It is an ennobling, enriching experience to just look down from the summit of a mountain. You bow down and make make your your obeisance to whichever God you worship. obeisance: I left on Everest a picture of Guru Nanak. Rawat left show your obedience or a picture of Goddess Durga. Phu Dorji left a relic of the submission Buddha. Edmund Hillary had buried a cross under a cairn (a heap of rocks and stones) in the snow. These are not symbols of conquest but of reverence. The experience of having climbed to the summit changes you completely. There is another summit. It is within yourself. It is in your own mind. Each man carries within himself his own mountain peak. He must climb it to reach to a fuller knowledge of himself. It is fearful, and unscalable. It cannot be climbed by anyone else. You yourself have to do it. The physical act of climbing to the The author and Phu-Dorji on summit of a mountain the summit of Mount Everest The Summit Within 75 Reprint 2024-25 outside is akin to the act of climbing the mountain within. The effects of both the climbs are the same. Whether the mountain you climb is physical or emotional and spiritual, the climb will certainly change you. It teaches you much about the world and about yourself. I venture to think that my experience as an Everester ordeals: has provided me with the inspiration to face life’s ordeals painful resolutely.

Some composition may be read aloud to the entire class afterwards. The Summit Within 79 Reprint 2024-25 The school boy in the poem is not a happy child. What makes him unhappy? Why does he compare himself to a bird that lives in a cage, or a plant that withers when it should blossom. I love to rise in a summer morn, When the birds sing on every tree; The distant huntsman winds his horn, And the skylark sings with me. O! what sweet company. But to go to school in a summer morn, O! it drives all joy away; Under a cruel eye outworn, The little ones spend the day, In sighing and dismay. Ah! then at times I drooping sit, And spend many an anxious hour. Nor in my book can I take delight, Nor sit in learning’s bower, Worn thro’ with the dreary shower. How can the bird that is born for joy, Sit in a cage and sing. How can a child when fears annoy, But droop his tender wing, And forget his youthful spring. 80 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 O!

The One Furrow When I was young, I went to school With pencil and footrule Sponge and slate, And sat on a tall stool At learning’s gate. When I was older, the gate swung wide; Clever and keen-eyed In I pressed, But found in the mind’s pride No peace, no rest.
