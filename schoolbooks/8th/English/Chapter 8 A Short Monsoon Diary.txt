UNIT 8 A Short Monsoon Diary Some extracts from the diary of a nature lover who enjoys the monsoon in the hills and observes the accompanying changes in the world of flora and fauna. Activities under working with language are numerous and of different types. Spend sufficient time on each activity and devise, wherever necessary, new but related exercises for further practice. The following project may be tried under writing. Do you notice the changes that occur in nature as the seasons change? Write five or six sentences about what you see in nature in your part of the country during the months of May, August and December. Record the daily temperature for a fortnight and note down the maximum and minimum temperatures. Comment on the rise and fall in temperature. Record the time of sunrise and sunset for a fortnight and check if there is any appreciable change in the time. On the Grasshopper and Cricket This poem is relatively difficult. The difficulty lies in its brevity of expression and complexity of thought. The introductory note and activities under working with the poem should be done elaborately adding additional explanatory notes/tasks, wherever necessary. Compare it with The Ant and the Cricket to bring out differences of style and theme clearly with examples. To concretise ‘the poetry of earth’ or ‘the sounds of nature’, use the poem given below, which is all about animal cries. 102 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 Ask children to rearrange the lines taking note of the words that rhyme. The last line of each stanza begins with ‘But’. Cows moo. Lions roar. But I speak. Bears snore. Doves coo. Crickets creak. Dogs growl. Horses neigh. But I talk. Wolves howl. Donkeys bray. Parrots squawk. Honeydew 103 Reprint 2024-25 Before you read Do you know what a diary is? It is a record of personal experiences written day after day over a long period of time. You can also use a diary to note down things you plan to do immediately or in future. One of the most famous diaries published as a book is The Diary of Anne Frank. Here are a few extracts from Ruskin Bond’s diary in which he portrays the silent miracles of nature and life’s little joys and regrets. Read on. I June 24 melancholy: The first day of monsoon mist. And it’s strange how all very sad (the mist is called the birds fall silent as the mist comes climbing up the melancholy hill.

What are the two ways in which the hills appear to change when the mist comes up? II August 2 drumming: All night the rain has been drumming on the falling noisily corrugated tin roof. There has been no storm, no thunder, just the steady swish of a tropical downpour. It helps me to lie awake; at the same time, it doesn’t keep me from sleeping. It is a good sound to read by — the rain outside, the quiet within — and, although tin roofs are given to springing unaccountable leaks, there is a feeling of being untouched by, and yet in touch with, the rain. August 3 The rain stops. The clouds begin to break up, the sun strikes the hill on my left. A woman is chopping up sticks. I hear the tinkle of cowbells. In the oak tree, a crow shakes the raindrops from his feathers and caws disconsolately: disconsolately. Water drips from a leaking drainpipe. unhappily And suddenly, clean and pure, the song of the whistling thrush emerges like a dark sweet secret from the depths ravine: of the ravine. valley August 12 Endless rain, and a permanent mist.

August 31 It is the last day of August, and the lush monsoon growth has reached its peak. The seeds of the cobra lily are turning red, signifying that the rains are coming to an end. In a few days the ferns will start turning yellow, but right now they are still firm, green and upright. Ground orchids, mauve lady’s slipper and the white butterfly orchids put on a fashion display on the grassy slopes of crevices: Landour.

After an evening hailstorm, the sky and hills are suffused with a beautiful golden light. A Short Monsoon Diary 107 Reprint 2024-25 January 26 Winter Rains in the Hills In the hushed silence of the house when I am quite alone, and my friend, who was here has gone, it is very lonely, very quiet, as I sit in a liquid silence, a silence within, surrounded by the rhythm of rain, the steady drift of water on leaves, on lemons, on roof, drumming on drenched dahlias and window panes, while the mist holds the house in a dark caress. As I pause near a window, the rain stops. And starts again. caress: And the trees, no longer green but grey, touching or menace me with their loneliness. holding lovingly March 23 menace: Late March.

The monsoons are a time of great fun and even a few adventures: playing in the rain and getting wet, wading through knee-deep water on your way to school, water flooding the house or the classroom, powercuts and so on.

The Oak The oak stands straight and tall, but not in boots, nor any shoes at all: just in roots. —Norma Farber 112 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 Unlike The Ant and the Cricket (page 21), which tells a story, this is a nature poem. In it, the grasshopper and cricket do not appear as characters in a story. Rather, they act as symbols, each suggesting something else. Read the poem and notice how ‘the poetry of earth’ keeps on through summer and winter in a neverending song. Who sings the song? The poetry of earth is never dead: When all the birds are faint with the hot sun, And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead, That is the grasshopper’s — he takes the lead In summer luxury — he has never done With his delights, for when tired out with fun He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed. The poetry of earth is ceasing never: On a lone winter evening when the frost Has wrought a silence, from the stone there shrills The cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever, And seems to one in drowsiness half lost; The grasshopper’s among some grassy hills. JOHN KEATS wrought: brought about shrills: comes through loud and clear A Short Monsoon Diary 113 Reprint 2024-25 1. Discuss with your partner the following definition of a poem.

The poetry of earth continues round the year through a cycle of two seasons. Mention each with its representative voice. Same is different The bandage was wound around the wound. The dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse. The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert. When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes. The insurance was invalid for the invalid. They were too close to the door to close it. There is no time like the present to present the present. 114 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25
