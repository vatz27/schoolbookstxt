UNITS 4-7 Bepin Choudhury’s Lapse of Memory A Satyajit Ray story with a surprise ending that brings in its wake the much needed psychological relief to the sophisticated executive beleagured by a conspiracy, which is a humorous take after all. Before asking children to read the text, tell the story part by part, each part ending where the listener wonders what comes next. Activity 3 under working with language is about two tense forms — simple past and present perfect. Notice how both have been used in conjunction with each other. The following explanatory notes may be useful. • The present perfect tense is used to refer to an action initiated and completed in the past and is associated with the present. It has its effect on the present situation. I have seen the Taj. (I know what it looks like.) He has arrived. (He is here.) I have finished my work. (I am free now.) Present perfect tense is usual with already, so far,not yet, ever, never etc. It is not used with ago, yesterday, last week/month/year, etc. The Last Bargain Here is a method of teaching that may be tried. (a) Let children read the first stanza silently. Ask the following questions. (i) How many persons/characters are there? (ii) Who are they? (iii) Who is big and who is small? (iv) What does the person in the first line say? (v) What does the other one in the fourth line say? (vi) Do they stay together or part company? Why? 50 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 (b) Now reconstruct the episode. Begin like this. I was walking on the road looking for work. I saw the king in his chariot. He had a sword in his hand. He was very kind to me. He shook my hand and offered to hire me. I did not accept his offer. To me, power is not a valuable thing. It is not permanent. It won’t make me happy. I was looking for something else as a reward for my work. What is he looking for? Let us read the next stanza. (c) Do the other stanzas in the same way. The clue to what the person is looking for lies in the last line. The operative phrases are ‘the child’s play’ and ‘a free man’. The child and her/his play is a metaphor for innocence and inward happiness, which gives this person a sense of fulfilment and freedom from stress and strife. He feels genuinely free and happy in the company of the child. Recite each stanza with feeling, pausing at the right places. The method suggested may work better for a poem with a story. The Summit Within Adventure and the world of nature – the arduous task of reaching the highest summit in the world makes the climber reflect on the ‘internal summits’ which are, perhaps, higher than the Everest. The text underscores the physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of the adventure in a single perspective. Divide the text into three parts.  A convenient division is suggested here. ‘...............that mountains are a means of communion with God’. (end of Part-I) ‘It is emotional. It is spiritual’. (end of Part-II) The remaining is Part-III. Design while-reading comprehension questions for each part. The multiple choice items are given at the end of the lesson. You may try the following as additional questions. What is the author’s personal answer to the question as to why people climb mountains? How is the same question answered in Part-II in a different way? Notes for the Teacher 51 Reprint 2024-25 Famous climbers have recorded how they needed just that help? Explain the italicised phrase. Looking round from the summit, you tell yourself that _____________________________. (a) Complete this sentence using the same words as in the text without referring to the book. (b) Now complete it using a clause/phrase of your own without changing meaning. Activities 2 and 3 under working with language provide ample opportunities for vocabulary development. Extend Activity 2 by choosing new words from the text to cover their adjective and/or adverb forms. remark – remarkable – remarkably type – typical – typically Use each item in a meaningful context, involving more than one sentence. ‘What you say is not appropriate, though it’s a good remark.’ ‘Isn’t that remarkable?’ ‘It may be so, but it doesn’t mean you are remarkably objective.’ You may not find the dialogue above remarkable enough, but it meets the immediate requirement appropriately. Re-read and discuss passages where the author’s admiration for the mountains and passion for adventure comes through. The School Boy A school is a place where children and teachers assemble every morning to learn from one another. Find out if any child would like to describe school in a different way. An interesting discussion on different types of schools, supported by pictures from magazines/newspapers, may ensue — a village school where children are sitting on the floor; another school where they are sitting at long desks; an outdoor lesson under a tree, etc. Ask children how they reach school. Do they walk or take a bus, etc.? What problems others in remote areas may face in reaching school on time? Any suggestions as to how to make school an interesting and enjoyable place! 52 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 This is Jody’s Fawn A story about a child’s emotional preoccupation with the fawn whose mother had to be killed to save his father’s life. The story highlights values such as compassion and justice, care and concern for human and animal life. Spend some time on a discussion about ‘home remedies’ for commonplace health problems/ailments. Should we see a doctor about every little thing, or should we talk to the grandmother first? The growing concern about preservation of environment and protection of animal life has gone a long way in persuading schools to refrain from dissecting animals for experiment. Elicit children’s comments on the issue and on the law that punishes humans for hurting animals. Activity 1 under working with language is about reporting questions – yes/no and wh-questions. The use of ‘if/whether’ in the case of yes/no type questions should be explicitly explained. Devise separate exercises for teaching the use of ‘if/whether’, the appropriate reporting verb, the changes in pronominals in the reported speech and the sequence of tenses. Here is a simple exercise to exemplify some of these points. Choose the correct word to complete statements in indirect speech given below. Write words in the blanks given. (a) “Where do you come from?” I ___________(said/asked) him where ______________ (he/ you) come from. (b) “What is your name?” He asked me what ____________ (my/his) name. (is/was) (c) “Are you happy?” I asked him ______________ (if/whether) he _____________ (is/was) happy. (d) “Do you live here?” He asked me ___________ (whether/if) I ____________ (live/ lived) ___________ (here/there). (e) “Why are you crying?” The teacher asked the child ______________ (if/why) she _____ (is/was/were) crying. Notes for the Teacher 53 Reprint 2024-25 Here is another exercise. Read the following dialogue between Jody and his father. Rewrite their conversation in indirect speech. Penny lay quiet, staring at the ceiling. “Boy, you’ve got me hemmed in.” “It won’t take much to raise the fawn. It will soon start eating leaves.” “You are smarter than boys of your age.” “We took its mother, and it wasn’t to blame.” “It seems ungrateful to leave it to starve.” Begin like this: Penny lay quiet staring at the ceiling. He said to Jody that ______________________________________________. Jody replied that it wouldn’t _________________________ Activity 2 under working with language deals with transitive and intransitive verbs. Ask children to underline the direct object in the following sentences. He brought me a colourful umbrella. I will write a letter to him. You should give yourself a chance. Activity 3 under writing may be linked with the first task covering home remedies under ‘Before you read,’ It will be useful to take it up separately also. A Visit to Cambridge Excerpt from a travelogue highlighting exchange of views between two extraordinary persons on what it means to be ‘differently abled’. A tour through Cambridge had a surprise, both pleasant and poignant, for the author. He met the brilliant and completely paralysed author of A Brief History of Time, and talked to him for a full half-hour. Activity 2 under working with language is about the present participle (dancing/walking) used as adjective. Running on the road, he saw __________. (participle) The train is running. __________ (verb) 54 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 The running train __________ (adjective) The use of past participle as adjective may also be illustrated here. He has broken the window. (verb) The window was broken when the almirah was taken out (verb — in passive) See the broken window. (adjective) Activity 3 under speaking and writing may be done as a project. Lot of oral work to precede the writing task. The final draft should be edited and improved before it is put up on the board. Activities 1 and 2 under speaking and writing are about word stress. Stressed syllables to be pronounced clearly and loudly. Some words of more than one syllable from the text may also be listed according to whether the stress falls on the first or the second syllable. Notes for the Teacher 55 Reprint 2024-25 Before you read Do you have a good memory? Has your memory ever played any tricks on you? Forgetfulness often puts you in a tight spot. But forgetting a part of your life completely may drive you crazy. In this story, Bepin Babu goes nearly crazy because he cannot recollect his stay at Ranchi. He has never been to Ranchi, he insists, though there are many witnesses to the contrary. What is the suspense all about? I Every Monday, on his way back from work, Bepin Choudhury would drop in at Kalicharan's in New Market to buy books. Crime stories, ghost stories and thrillers. He had to buy at least five at a time to last him through idle chat: the week. He lived alone, was not a good mixer, had few unnecessary, friends, and didn’t like spending time in idle chat. Today, routine at Kalicharan’s, Bepin Babu had the feeling that conversation someone was observing him from close quarters. He meek: turned round and found himself looking at a round quiet; humble faced, meek looking man who now broke into a smile. “I don’t suppose you recognise me.” “Have we met before?” asked Bepin Babu. The man looked greatly surprised. “We met every day for a whole week. I arranged for a car to take you to the Hudroo falls. 5 6 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 In 1958. In Ranchi. My name is Parimal Ghose.” “Ranchi?” Now Bepin Babu realised that it was not he but this man who was making a mistake. Bepin Babu had never been to Ranchi. He had been at the point of going several times, but never made it. He smiled and said, “Do you know who I am?” The man raised his eyebrows, bit his tongue and said, “Do I know you? Who doesn’t know Bepin Choudhury?” Bepin Babu now turned towards the bookshelves and said, “Still you’re making a mistake. One often does. I’ve never been to Ranchi.” The man now laughed aloud. “What are you saying, Mr Choudhury? You had a fall in Hudroo and cut your right knee. I brought you iodine. I had fixed up a car for you to go to Netarhat the next day, but you couldn’t because of the pain in the knee. Can’t you recall anything? Someone else you know was also in Ranchi at that time. Mr Dinesh Mukerji. You stayed in a bungalow. You said you didn’t like hotel food and would prefer to have your meals cooked by a Bepin Choudhury’s Lapse of Memory 5 7 Reprint 2024-25 bawarchi. Mr Mukerji stayed with his sister. You had a big argument about the moon landing, remember? I’ll tell you more: you always carried a bag with your books in it on your sight-seeing trips. Am I right or not?” Bepin Babu spoke quietly, his eyes still on the books. “Which month in ’58 are you talking about?” The man said, “October.” “No, sir,” said Bepin Babu. “I spent Puja in ’58 with a friend in Kanpur. You’re making a mistake. Good day.” But the man didn’t go, nor did he stop talking. “Very strange. One evening I had tea with you in a veranda of your bungalow. You spoke about your family. You said you had no children, and that you had lost your wife ten years ago. Your only brother had died insane, which is why you didn’t want to visit the mental hospital in Ranchi...” When Bepin Babu had paid for the books and was leaving the shop, the man was still looking at him in utter disbelief: utter disbelief. complete surprise Comprehension Check 1. Why did the man stare at Bepin Babu in disbelief? 2. Where did Bepin Babu say he went in October '58? 3. Mention any three (or more) things that Parimal Ghose knew about Bepin Babu. II Bepin Babu’s car was safely parked in Bertram Street by the Lighthouse Cinema. He told the driver as he got into the car, “Just drive by the Ganga, will you, Sitaram.” Driving up the Strand Road, Bepin Babu regretted having paid so much attention to the intruder. He had (his) head never been to Ranchi — no question about it. It was reeled: he was inconceivable that he should forget such an incident shocked and which took place only six or seven years ago. He had an confused excellent memory. Unless — Bepin Babu’s head reeled. 5 8 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 Was he losing his mind? But how could that be? He losing his was working daily in his office. It was a big firm, and he mind: becoming was doing a responsible job. He wasn’t aware of anything mad ever going seriously wrong. Only today he spoke for half an hour at an important meeting. And yet... And yet the man knew a great deal about him. How? He even seemed to know some intimate details. The bag intimate: of books, wife’s death, brother’s insanity... The only very personal mistake was about his having gone to Ranchi. Not a and private mistake; a deliberate lie. In ’58, during the Pujas, he was in Kanpur at his friend Haridas Bagchi’s place. All Bepin Babu had to do was write to — no, there was no way of writing to Haridas. Bepin Babu suddenly remembered that Haridas had left with his wife for Japan some weeks ago, and he didn’t have his address. But where was the need for proof? He himself was fully aware that he hadn’t been to Ranchi — and that was that. The river breeze was bracing, and yet a slight bracing: discomfort lingered in Bepin Babu’s mind. stimulating Around Hastings, Bepin Babu decided to roll up his trousers and take a look at his right knee. There was the mark of an old inch-long cut. It was impossible to tell when the injury had occurred. Bepin Choudhury’s Lapse of Memory 5 9 Reprint 2024-25 Had he never had a fall as a boy and cut his knee? He tried to recall such an incident, but couldn’t. Then Bepin Babu suddenly thought of Dinesh Mukerji. The man had said that Dinesh was in Ranchi at the same time. The best thing surely would be to ask him. He lived quite near — in Beninandan Street. What about going right now? But then, if he had really never been to Ranchi, what would Dinesh think if Bepin Babu asked for a confirmation? He would probably conclude going nuts: Bepin Babu was going nuts. No; it would be ridiculous going mad/ to ask him. crazy And he knew how ruthless Dinesh’s sarcasm could be. Sipping a cold drink in his air-conditioned living room, Bepin Babu felt at ease again. Such a nuisance! Just because they have nothing else to do, they go about getting into getting into other people’s hair. people’s hair: After dinner, snuggling in bed with one of the new interfering thrillers, Bepin Babu forgot all about the man in New with and annoying Market. people. Next day, in the office, Bepin Babu noticed that with every passing hour, the previous day’s encounter was occupying more and more of his mind. If the man knew so much about Bepin Babu, how could he make such a mistake about the Ranchi trip? Just before lunch Bepin Babu decided to ring up Dinesh Mukerji. It was better to settle the question over the phone; at least the embarrassment on his face wouldn’t show. Two-Three-Five-Six-One-Six. Bepin Babu dialled the number. “Hallo.” “Is that Dinesh? This is Bepin here.” “Well, well — what’s the news?” “I just wanted to find out if you recalled an incident which took place in’ 58.” 6 0 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 “’58? What incident?” “Were you in Calcutta right through that year? That’s the first thing I’ve got to know.” “Wait just a minute... ’58... just let me check in my diary.” For a minute there was silence. Bepin Babu could feel that his heartbeat had gone up. He was sweating a little. “Hallo.” “Yes.” “I've got it. I’d been out twice.” “Where?” “Once in February — nearby — to Krishnanagar to a nephew’s wedding. And then... but you’d know about this one. The trip to Ranchi. You were there too. That’s all. But what’s all this sleuthing about?” sleuthing: “No. I just wanted to — anyway, thanks.” investigating Bepin Babu slammed the receiver down and gripped (an event) his head with his hands. He felt his head swimming. A chill seemed to spread over his body. There were sandwiches in his tiffin box, but he didn’t eat them. He had lost his appetite. Comprehension Check 1. Why did Bepin Babu worry about what Parimal Ghose had said? 2. How did he try to decide who was right—his memory or Parimal Ghose? 3. Why did Bepin Babu hesitate to visit Mr Mukerji? Why did he  finally decide to phone him? 4. What did Mr Mukerji say? Did it comfort Bepin Babu, or add to his worries? III After lunch-time, Bepin Babu realised that he couldn’t possibly carry on sitting at his desk and working. This carry on: had never happened in the twenty-five years he had continue been with the firm. He had a reputation for being a Bepin Choudhury’s Lapse of Memory 6 1 Reprint 2024-25 conscientious: tireless, conscientious worker. But today his head was careful and in a whirl. correct Back home at two-thirty, Bepin Babu lay down in head was in  a whirl: bed and tried to gather his wits together.

He had always wanted to go to Ranchi; to have make an effort gone there, done things, and not to remember was to become something utterly impossible. calm and At seven thirty, Bepin Babu’s servant came and think clearly announced, “Chuni Babu, sir. Says it’s very important.” Bepin Babu knew what Chuni had come for. Chunilal having a had been at school with him. He’d been having a rough rough time: time lately and had been coming to see him about a having a lot of job.

Do you remember clearly?” Chuni sat down on the sofa, fixed Bepin Babu with a long, hard stare and said, “Bepin, have you taken to drugs or something? As far as I know, you had a clean record where such things were concerned. I know that old friendships don’t mean much to you, but at least you had a good memory. You can’t really mean that you’ve forgotten about the Ranchi trip?” Bepin Babu had to turn away from Chuni’s incredulous stare. “Do you remember what my last job was?” asked Chunilal. “Of course. You worked in a travel agency.” “You remember that and you don’t remember that it was I who fixed up your railway booking for Ranchi? I went to the station to see you off; one of the fans in your compartment was not working — I got an electrician to fix it. Have you forgotten everything? Whatever is the matter with you? You don’t look too well, you know.” Bepin Babu sighed and shook his head. “I’ve been working too hard,” he said at last. “That must be the reason. Must see about consulting a must see about specialist.” consulting: Doubtless it was Bepin’s condition which made (here) may have to Chunilal leave without mentioning anything about a job. consult Paresh Chanda was a young physician with a pair of bright eyes and a sharp nose. He became thoughtful when he heard about Bepin Babu’s symptoms. “Look, Dr Chanda,” said Bepin Babu desperately, “You must cure me of this horrible illness. I can’t tell you how it's affecting my work.” Bepin Choudhury’s Lapse of Memory 6 3 Reprint 2024-25 Dr Chanda shook his head. “You know what, Mr Choudhury,” he said. “I’ve never had to deal with a case such as yours. Frankly, this is quite outside my field of experience. But I have one suggestion. I don’t know if it’ll work, but it’s worth a try. It can do no harm.” Bepin Babu leaned forward anxiously. “As far as I can make out,” said Dr Chanda, “And I think you’re of the same opinion — you must have been to Ranchi, but due to some unknown reason, the entire episode has slipped out of your mind. What I suggest is that you go to Ranchi once again. The sight of the place may remind you of your trip. This is not impossible. More than that I cannot do at the moment.

IV Getting off the train at Ranchi next morning, he realised at once that he had never been there before. He came out of the station, took a taxi and drove around the town for a while. He realised that the streets, the buildings, the hotels, the bazaars, the Morabadi Hill — with none of these had he the slightest acquaintance. Would a trip to the Hudroo Falls help? He didn't believe so, but, at the same time, he didn't wish to leave with the feeling that he hadn’t tried enough. So he arranged for a car and left for Hudroo in the afternoon. 6 4 Honeydew Reprint 2024-25 At five o’clock the same afternoon in Hudroo, two Gujarati gentlemen from a group of picnickers discovered Bepin Babu lying unconscious beside a boulder. When came round: he came round, the first thing Bepin Babu said was, regained “I’m finished. There’s no hope left.” consciousness Next morning, Bepin Babu was back in Calcutta. He realised that there was truly no hope for him. Soon he would lose everything: his will to work, his confidence, his ability, his balance of mind. Was he going to end up in the asylum at...? Bepin Babu couldn’t think any more. Back home, he rang up Dr Chanda and asked him to come over. Then, after a shower, he got into bed with an ice bag clamped on his head. Just then the servant brought him a letter which someone had left in the letter box. A greenish envelope with his name in red ink on it. Above the name it said ‘Urgent and Confidential’. In spite of his condition, Bepin Babu had a feeling that he ought to go through the letter. He tore open the envelope and took out the letter. This is what he read — Bepin Choudhury’s Lapse of Memory 6 5 Reprint 2024-25 Dear Bepin, I had no idea that affluence would bring about the kind of change in you that it has done.
