Amartya Sen added a new all people at all times. The poor dimension to food security and households are more vulnerable to food emphasised the “access” to food through insecurity whenever there is a problem what he called ‘entitlements’ — a of production or distribution of food combination of what one can produce, crops. Food security depends on the exchange in the market alongwith state Public Distribution System (PDS) and or other socially provided supplies. government vigilance and action at Accordingly, there has been a substantial times, when this security is threatened. shift in the understanding of food security. The 1995 World Food Summit declared, What is food security? “Food security at the individual, Food is as essential for living as air is for household, regional, national and global breathing. But food security means levels exists when all people, at all times, something more than getting two square have physical and economic access to meals. Food security has following sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet dimensions their dietary needs and food preferences (a) for an active and healthy life” (FAO, 1996, availability of food means food p.3). The declaration further recognises production within the country, food that “poverty eradication is essential to imports and the previous years stock improve access to food”. stored in government granaries.

Poor people suffer from chronic hunger because of their very low income and in turn inability to buy food even for survival. Seasonal hunger is related to cycles of food growing and harvesting. This is prevalent in rural areas because of the seasonal nature of agricultural activities and in urban areas because of casual labourers, e.g., there is less work for casual construction labourers during the rainy season. This type of hunger exists Picture 4.3  A farmer from Punjab standing in when a person is unable to get work for a field of one of the High Yielding the entire year.

The people living below the poverty line might be food insecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to calamity or disaster. Although a large section of people suffer from food and nutrition insecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households in rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers engaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are disproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically backward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions more prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of the society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is composed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In addition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which comprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS); Food-for-Work (FFW); Mid-Day Meals; Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) etc. In addition to the role of the government in ensuring food security, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards this direction.
