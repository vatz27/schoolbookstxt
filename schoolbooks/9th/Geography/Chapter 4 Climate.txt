On the basis of the generalised monthly atmospheric conditions, Let us now look at precipitation.

In Table-I, the average mean monthly temperatures and amounts of rainfall of 10 representative stations have been given.  It is for you to study on your own and convert them into ‘temperature and rainfall’ graphs. A glance at these visual representations will help you to grasp instantly the smilarities and differences between them. One such graph (Figure 1) is already prepared for you.  See if you can arrive at some broad generalisations about our diverse climatic conditions. We hope you are in for a great joy of learning. Do the following activities. 2.

Now find out (i) Why are Thiruvananthapuram and Shillong rainier in June than in July? (ii) Why is July rainier in Mumbai than in Thiruvananthapuram? (iii) Why are southwest monsoons less rainy in Chennai? (iv) Why is Shillong rainier than Kolkata? (v) Why is Kolkata rainier in July than in June unlike Shillong which is rainier in June than in July? (vi) Why does Delhi receive more rain than Jodhpur? 5. Now think why — Thiruvananthapuram has equable climate? — Chennai has more rains only after the fury of monsoon is over in most parts of the country? — Jodhpur has a hot desert type of climate? — Leh has moderate  precipitation almost throughut the year? — while in Delhi and Jodhpur most of the rain is confined to nearly three  months, in Thiruvananthapuram and Shillong it is almost nine months of the year? In spite of these facts see carefully if there are strong evidences to conclude that the monsoons still provide a very strong framework lending overall climatic unity to the whole country. 38 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I 2024-25
