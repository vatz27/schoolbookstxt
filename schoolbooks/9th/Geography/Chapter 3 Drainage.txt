You will notice that small streams controlled by the broad relief features of the flowing from different directions come together subcontinent. Accordingly, the Indian rivers to form the main river, which ultimately drains are divided into two major groups: into a large water body such as a lake or a sea • the Himalayan rivers; and or an ocean. The area drained by a single river • the Peninsular rivers. system is called a drainage basin. A closer Apart from originating from the two major observation on a map will indicate that any physiographic regions of India, the Himalayan elevated area, such as a mountain or an upland, and the Peninsular rivers are different from separates two drainage basins. Such an upland each other in many ways. Most of the is known as a water divide (Figure 3.1). Himalayan rivers are perennial.  It means that they have water throughout the year.

A river alongwith its in their floodplains. They also have welldeveloped deltas (Figure 3.3). tributaries may be called a river system. The Indus River System Source of River The river Indus rises in Tibet, near Lake Mansarowar. Flowing west, it enters India in the Upper Course Ladakh. It forms a picturesque gorge in this part. Several tributaries, the Zaskar, the Nubra, the Shyok and the Hunza, join it in the Kashmir Middle Course region. The Indus flows through Baltistan and Gilgit and emerges from the mountains at Attock. The Satluj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum join together to enter the Indus near Mithankot in Pakistan. Beyond this, the Indus Meander Ox-Bow Lake flows southwards eventually reaching the Arabian Sea, east of Karachi.   The Indus plain Lower has a very gentle slope. With a total length of Course 2900 km, the Indus is one of the longest rivers of the world. A little over a third of the Indus basin is located in India Ladakh, Jammu and Delta Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the rest is in Pakistan. Figure 3.3 : Some Features Made by Rivers A large number of the Peninsular rivers are • According to the regulations seasonal, as their flow is dependent on rainfall. of the Indus Water Treaty (1960), India can During the dry season, even the large rivers use only 20 per cent of the total water carried by the Indus river system.
