CHAPTER 5 DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS OVERVIEW In the previous two chapters we have looked at two major elements of a democratic government. In Chapter 3 we saw how a democratic government has to be periodically elected by the people in a free and fair manner. In Chapter 4 we learnt that a democracy must be based on institutions that follow certain rules and procedures. These elements are necessary but not sufficient for a democracy. Elections and institutions need to be combined with a third element – enjoyment of rights – to make a government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working through the established institutional process must learn not to cross some limits. Citizens’ democratic rights set those limits in a democracy. This is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by discussing some real life cases to imagine what it means to live without rights. This leads to a discussion on what we mean by rights and why do we need them. As in the previous chapters, the general discussion is followed by a focus on India. We discuss one by one the Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution. Then we turn to how these rights can be used by ordinary citizens. Who will protect and enforce them? Finally we take a look at how the scope of rights has been expanding. 74 DEMOCRATIC POLITICS 2024-25 5.1 LIFE WITHOUT RIGHTS In this book we have mentioned were quite central to the rights again and again.

What Can you recall these? What exactly No person can legally claim any is the point in do these rights mean for an ordinary special treatment or privilege just talking about citizen? Let us look at these one by because he or she happens to be an equality before one. important person. For example, a few law? years ago a former Prime Minister of the country faced a court case on charges of cheating. The court finally declared that he was not guilty. But Right to as long as the case continued, he had Equality to go to the court, give evidence and Right to file papers, just like any other citizen. Right to Freedom This basic position is further Constitutional clarified in the Constitution by Remedies spelling out some implications of the Right to Equality. The government shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, ãF U N D A M E N T A L  R I G H T S race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every citizen shall have access to public places like shops, restaurants, hotels, and cinema halls. Similarly, there Cultural and Right shall be no restriction with regard to the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, Educational     against Rights Right to        Exploitation roads, playgrounds and places of Freedom public resorts maintained by of government or dedicated to the use Religion of general public. This might appear very obvious, but it was necessary to DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS 79 2024-25 incorporate these rights in the Constitution of our country where the traditional caste system did not allow people from some communities to access all public places. The same principle applies to public jobs. All citizens have equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment or appointment to any position in the government. No citizen shall be discriminated against or made ineligible for employment on the grounds mentioned above. You have read in Chapter 4 that the Government of India has provided reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. Various governments have different schemes for giving preference to women, poor or physically handicapped in some kinds of jobs. Are these reservations against the A C T I V I T Y right to equality? They are not. For equality does not mean giving < Go to the playground of the school or any staeveryone the same treatment, no dium and watch a 400 metre race on any track. matter what they need.
