What constitutes ‘work’ depends What is work? There is a difference in the on the way we define it. We use and define way we use the term ‘work’ in day-to-day life the term work differently in science.  To and the way we use it in science.  To make understand this let us do the following this point clear let us consider a few examples. activities: 10.1.1 NOT MUCH ‘WORK’ IN SPITE OF Activity _____________10.1 WORKING HARD! • We have discussed in the above Kamali is preparing for examinations. She paragraphs a number of activities spends lot of time in studies. She reads books, which we normally consider to be work 2024-25 in day-to-day life. For each of these Activity _____________10.3 activities, ask the following questions and answer them: • Think of situations when the object (i) What is the work being done on? is not displaced in spite of a force (ii) What is happening to the object? acting on it. (iii) Who (what) is doing the work? • Also think of situations when an object gets displaced in the absence of a force 10.1.2S acting on it. CIENTIFIC CONCEPTION OF WORK • List all the situations that you can To understand the way we view work and think of for each. • Discuss with your friends whether define work from the point of view of science, work is done in these situations. let us consider some situations: Push a pebble lying on a surface. The 10.1.3 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT pebble moves through a distance. You exerted a force on the pebble and the pebble got FORCE displaced. In this situation work is done. How is work defined in science? To A girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves understand this, we shall first consider the through a distance.  The girl has exerted a case when the force is acting in the direction force on the trolley and it is displaced. of displacement. Therefore, work is done. Let a constant force, F act on an object. Lift a book through a height. To do this Let the object be displaced through a you must apply a force.  The book rises up. distance, s in the direction of the force (Fig. There is a force applied on the book and the 10.1). Let W be the work done. We define work book has moved.  Hence, work is done. to be equal to the product of the force and A closer look at the above situations displacement. reveals that two conditions need to be Work done = force × displacement satisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should W = F s  (10.1) act on an object, and (ii) the object must be displaced. If any one of the above conditions does not exist, work is not done. This is the way we view work in science. A bullock is pulling a cart.  The cart moves. There is a force on the cart and the cart has moved. Do you think that work is done in this situation? Activity _____________10.2 • Think of some situations from your Fig. 10.1 daily life involving work. • List them. Thus, work done by a force acting on an • Discuss with your friends whether object is equal to the magnitude of the force work is being done in each situation. multiplied by the distance moved in the • Try to reason out your response. direction of the force.

(10.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then is done? the work done by the force will be 1 N m. • What happens to the object on which Here the unit of work is newton metre (N m) work is done? or joule  (J).  Thus 1 J is the amount of work 114 SCIENCE 2024-25 done on an object when a force of 1 N displaces it by 1 m along the line of action of the force. Look at Eq. (10.1) carefully.  What is the work done when the force on the object is zero? What would be the work done when the displacement of the object is zero? Refer to the conditions that are to be satisfied to Fig. 10.4 say that work is done. Consider a situation in which an object is moving with a uniform velocity along a Example 10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on particular direction. Now a retarding force, F, an object. The object is displaced is applied in the opposite direction. That is, through 2 m in the direction of the force the angle between the two directions is 180º. (Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object Let the object stop after a displacement s. In all through the displacement, then work such a situation, the work done by the force, done is 5 N × 2 m  =10 N m or 10 J. F is taken as negative and denoted by the minus sign. The work done by the force is F × (–s) or (–F × s). It is clear from the above discussion that the work done by a force can be either positive or negative. To understand this, let us do the following activity: Fig. 10.2 Activity _____________10.4 uestion • Lift an object up. Work is done by the 1.

Let us take it that the force of gravity acting on the object. force acts on the object through • Which one of these forces is doing the displacement. What is the positive work? work done in this case? • Which one is doing negative work? • Give reasons. Work done is negative when the force acts opposite to the direction of displacement. Work done is positive when the force is in the Fig. 10.3 direction of displacement. Example 10.2 A porter lifts a luggage of Consider another situation in which the force and the displacement are in the same 15 kg from the ground and puts it on direction:  a baby pulling a toy car parallel to his head 1.5 m above the ground. the ground, as shown in Fig. 10.4.

Consider Mass of the object, m = 15 kg, velocity an object of mass, m moving with a uniform of the object, v = 4 m s–1. velocity, u. Let it now be displaced through a distance s when a constant force, F acts on it From Eq. (10.5), in the direction of its displacement.  From 1 E = m v2 Eq. (10.1), the work done, W is F s. The work k 2 done on the object will cause a change in its velocity. Let its velocity change from u to v. 1 =  × 15 kg × 4 m s–1 × 4 m s–1 Let a be the acceleration produced. 2 We studied three equations of motion. The = 120 J relation connecting the initial velocity (u) The kinetic energy of the object is 120 J. and final velocity (v) of an object moving with a uniform acceleration a, and the displacement, s is Example 10.4 What is the work to be done v2 – u2 = 2a s to increase the velocity of a car from 30 km h–1 to 60 km h–1 if the mass of This gives the car is 1500 kg? 2 2 v – u s = (10.2) 2a Solution: From section 9.4, we know F = m a. Thus, Mass of the car, m =1500 kg, using (Eq. 10.2) in Eq.

WORK AND ENERGY 119 2024-25 10.2.4 POTENTIAL ENERGY OF AN OBJECT The potential energy of an object at AT A  HEIGHT a height depends on the ground level or the zero level you choose.  An An object increases its energy when raised object in a given position can have a through a height. This is because work is certain potential energy with respect done on it against gravity while it is being to one level and a different value of raised. The energy present in such an object potential energy with respect to is the gravitational potential energy. another level. The gravitational potential energy of an object at a point above the ground is defined as the work done in raising it from the ground It is useful to note that the work done by to that point against gravity. gravity depends on the difference in vertical It is easy to arrive at an expression for heights of the initial and final positions of the object and not on the path along which the gravitational potential energy of an object the object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case at a height. where a block is raised from position A to B by taking two different paths. Let the height AB = h. In both the situations the work done on the object is mgh. Fig. 10.7 Fig. 10.8 Consider an object of mass, m. Let it be raised through a height, h from the ground. Example 10.5 Find the energy possessed A force is required to do this.

That is, work done, W = force × displacement Mass of the object, m = 10 kg, = mg × h displacement (height), h = 6 m, and = mgh acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2. Since work done on the object is equal to From Eq. (10.6), mgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained Potential energy = mgh by the object. This is the potential energy (E ) = 10 kg × 9.8 m s–2 × 6 m P = 588 J. of the object. The potential energy  is 588 J.

If an m J J J agent does a work W  in time t, then power is 4 given by: 3 Power = work/time 2 W 1 or P = (10.8) t Just above The unit of power is watt [in honour of the ground James Watt (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol • For simplifying the calculations, take W. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which the value of g as 10 m s–2. does work at the rate of 1 joule per second. We can also say that power is 1 W when the Think it over ! rate of consumption of energy is    1 J s–1. 1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s–1 What would have happened if nature had . not allowed the transformation of energy? We express larger rates of energy transfer in There is a view that life could not have kilowatts (kW). been possible without transformation of 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts energy. Do you agree with this? 1 kW = 1000 W 1 kW = 1000 J s–1. The power of an agent may vary with time. 10.3 Rate of Doing Work This means that the agent may be doing work Do all of us work at the same rate? Do at different rates at different intervals of time. machines consume or transfer energy at the Therefore the concept of average power is same rate? Agents that transfer energy do useful.

WORK AND ENERGY 123 2024-25 What you have learnt • Work done on an object is defined as the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved by the object in the direction of the applied force. The unit of work is joule: 1 joule = 1 newton × 1 metre. • Work done on an object by a force would be zero if the displacement of the object is zero. • An object having capability to do work is said to possess energy. Energy has the same unit as that of work. • An object in motion possesses what is known as the kinetic energy of the object. An object of mass, m moving with 1 velocity v has a kinetic energy of mv2 . 2 • The energy possessed by a body due to its change in position or shape is called the potential energy. The gravitational potential energy of an object of mass, m raised through a height, h from the earth’s surface is given by m g h. • According to the law of conservation of energy, energy can only be transformed from one form to another; it can neither be created nor destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation always remains constant. • Energy exists in nature in several forms such as kinetic energy, potential energy, heat energy, chemical energy etc. The sum of the kinetic and potential energies of an object is called its mechanical energy. • Power is defined as the rate of doing work. The SI unit of power is watt. 1 W = 1 J/s.
