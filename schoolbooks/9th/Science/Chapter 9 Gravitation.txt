In this chapter we shall learn about gravitation and the universal law of gravitation. We shall discuss the motion of objects under the influence of gravitational force on the earth. We shall study how the weight of a body varies from place to place. We shall also discuss the conditions for objects to float in liquids. 9.1 Gravitation We know that the moon goes around the earth. An object when thrown upwards, reaches a certain height and then falls downwards. It is said that when Newton was sitting under a tree, Fig. 9.1: A stone describing a circular path with a an apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made velocity of constant magnitude. Newton start thinking. He thought that: if the earth can attract an apple, can it not attract Before the thread is released, the stone the moon? Is the force the same in both cases? moves in a circular path with a certain speed He conjectured  that the same type of force is and changes direction at every point. responsible in both the cases. He argued that The change in direction involves change in at each point of its orbit, the moon falls velocity or acceleration. The force that causes towards the earth, instead of going off in a this acceleration and keeps the body moving straight line. So, it must be attracted by the along the circular path is acting towards earth. But we do not really see the moon falling the centre. This force is called the towards the earth. centripetal (meaning ‘centre-seeking’) force. 100 SCIENCE 2024-25 In the absence of this force, the stone flies off 9.1.1 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION along a straight line. This straight line will be a tangent to the circular path. Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely Tangent to a circle proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force is along the line joining the centres of two objects. A straight line that meets the circle at one and only one point is called a Mm F = G tangent to the circle. Straight line 2 d ABC is a tangent to the circle at point B. Fig. 9.2: The gravitational force between two uniform objects is directed along the line The motion of the moon around the earth joining their centres. is due to the centripetal force. The centripetal force is provided by the force of attraction of Let two objects A and B of masses M and the earth. If there were no such force, the m lie at a distance d from each other as shown moon would pursue a uniform straight line in Fig. 9.2. Let the force of attraction between motion. two objects be F. According to the universal It is seen that a falling apple is attracted law of gravitation, the force between two towards the earth. Does the apple attract the objects is directly proportional to the product earth? If so, we do not see the earth moving of their masses. That is, towards an apple. Why? F∝M × m (9.1) According to the third law of motion, the And the force between two objects is inversely apple does attract the earth. But according proportional to the square of the distance to the second law of motion, for a given force, between them, that is, acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an 1 apple is negligibly small compared to that of F ∝ 2 (9.2) d the earth. So, we do not see the earth moving towards the apple. Extend the same argument Combining Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2), we get for why the earth does not move towards the moon. M ×m In our solar system, all the planets go F ∝  2 (9.3) d around the Sun. By arguing the same way, we can say that there exists a force between M × m the Sun and the planets. From the above facts or,  F = G 2 (9.4) d Newton concluded that not only does the earth attract an apple and the moon, but all where G is the constant of proportionality and objects in the universe attract each other. This is called the universal gravitation constant. force of attraction between objects is called By multiplying crosswise, Eq. (9.4) gives the gravitational force.  F × d 2 = G M × m GRAVITATION 101 2024-25 More to  know 2 From Eq.

Inverse-square 9.1.2 IMPORTANCE OF THE UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION Saying that F is inversely proportional to the square of d The universal law of gravitation successfully means, for example, that if d gets explained several phenomena which were bigger by a factor of 6, F becomes believed to be unconnected: 1 (i) the force that binds us to the earth; times smaller.

If the distance between the 9.2 Free Fall earth and the moon is 3.84×105 km, calculate the force exerted by the earth on Let us try to understand the meaning of free the moon.

This is due to the = 3.84 × 105 × 1000 m gravitational force. Whenever objects fall = 3.84 × 108 m towards the earth under this force alone, we G = 6.7 × 10–11 N m2 kg–2 say that the objects are in free fall. Is there any 102 SCIENCE 2024-25 More to  know change in the velocity of falling objects? While calculations, we can take g to be more or less falling, there is no change in the direction of constant on or near the earth. But for objects motion of the objects. But due to the earth’s far from the earth, the acceleration due to attraction, there will be a change in the gravitational force of earth is given by magnitude of the velocity. Any change in Eq. (9.7). velocity involves acceleration. Whenever an object falls towards the earth, an acceleration 9.2.1 TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF g is involved. This acceleration is due to the earth’s gravitational force. Therefore, this To calculate the value of g, we should put   the acceleration is called the acceleration due to values of G, M and R in Eq. (9.9), namely, the gravitational force of the earth (or universal gravitational constant, G = 6.7 × 10–11 N m2 kg-2 acceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by , mass of the earth, M = 6 × 1024 kg, g. The unit of g is the same as that of and radius of the earth,  R = 6.4 × 106 m. acceleration, that is, m s–2. M We know from the second law of motion g = G 2 that force is the product of mass and R acceleration. Let the mass of the stone in 6.7 ×10-11 N m2 kg-2 24 ×6 ×10 kg activity 9.2 be m. We already know that there = is acceleration involved in falling objects due (6.4 6 ×10 m)2 to the gravitational force and is denoted by g.       = 9.8 m s–2. Therefore the magnitude of the gravitational force F will be equal to the product of mass Thus, the value of acceleration due to gravity and acceleration due to the gravitational of the earth, g = 9.8 m s–2. force, that is, F = m g (9.6) 9.2.2 MOTION OF OBJECTS UNDER THE From Eqs.

Thus, for whether both of them reach the objects on or near the surface of the earth, ground simultaneously. • We see that paper reaches the ground M × m mg = G 2 (9.8) little later than the stone. This happens R because of air resistance. The air offers resistance due to friction to the motion M of the falling objects. The resistance g = G 2 (9.9) R offered by air to the paper is more than the resistance offered to the stone. If The earth is not a perfect sphere. As the we do the experiment in a glass jar radius of the earth increases from the poles to from which air has been sucked out, the equator, the value of g becomes greater at the paper and the stone would fall at the poles than at the equator. For most the same rate. GRAVITATION 103 2024-25 We know that an object experiences u +v (ii) average speed= acceleration during free fall. From Eq.

In the same way, the weight of an object on the moon is the force with We have learnt in the previous chapter that the which the moon attracts that object. The mass mass of an object is the measure of its inertia . of the moon is less than that of the earth. Due We have also learnt that greater the mass, the to this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction greater is the inertia. It remains the same on objects. whether the object is on the earth, the moon Let the mass of an object be m. Let its or even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an weight on the moon be W . Let the mass of m object is constant and does not change from the moon be M  and its radius be R . m m place to place. By applying the universal law of gravitation, the weight of the object on the moon will be 9.4 Weight M ×m W = G m m 2 (9.16) We know that the earth attracts every object R m with a certain force and this force depends on Let the weight of the same object on the the mass (m) of the object and the acceleration earth be W . The mass of the earth is M and its e due to the gravity (g). The weight of an object radius is R. is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth.

Substituting the same in Eq. (9.14), we have W = m × g (9.15) From Eqs. (9.9) and (9.15) we have, As the weight of an object is the force with M × m W = G which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI e 2  (9.17) R unit of weight is the same as that of force, that Substituting the values from Table 10.1 in is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting Eqs.

It is due to this reason that at e a given place, we can use the weight of an Dividing Eq. (9.18a) by Eq. (9.18b), we get object as a measure of its mass.

When you The dimensions lie down, the same force acts on an area equal = 40 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm to the contact area of your whole body, which Here, the weight of the wooden block is larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the effects of forces of the same magnitude on applies a thrust on the table top. different areas are different. In the above That is, cases, thrust is the same.

Find the pressure exerted The pressure exerted by the side 20 cm × 10 cm is 2450 N m–2 and by the side 40 cm × 20 cm is 612.5 N m–2. Thus, the same force acting on a smaller area exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller pressure on a larger area. This is the reason why a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp edges and buildings have wide foundations. 9.5.1 PRESSURE IN FLUIDS All liquids and gases are fluids.

The force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth acts on the bottle in the downward direction. So the bottle is pulled downwards. But the water exerts an upward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is pushed upwards. We have learnt that weight of an object is the force due to gravitational attraction of the earth.

What you have learnt • The law of gravitation states that the force of attraction between any two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  The law applies to objects anywhere in the universe.  Such a law is said to be universal. • Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved. • The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies on the surface of the earth, decreasing from poles to the equator. • The weight of a body is the force with which the earth attracts it. • The weight is equal to the product of mass and acceleration due to gravity. • The weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays constant. 110 SCIENCE 2024-25 • All objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid. • Objects having density less than that of the liquid in which they are immersed, float on the surface of the liquid. If the density of the object is more than the density of the liquid in which it is immersed then it sinks in the liquid. Exercises 1.

What is the acceleration of free fall? 9. What do we call the gravitational force between the earth and an object? 10. Amit buys few grams of gold at the poles as per the instruction of one of his friends. He hands over the same when he meets him at the equator. Will the friend agree with the weight of gold bought? If not, why? [Hint: The value of g is greater at the poles than at the equator.] 11. Why will a sheet of paper fall slower than one that is crumpled into a ball? 1 12. Gravitational force on the surface of the moon is only  as 6 strong as gravitational force on the earth. What is the weight in newtons of a 10 kg object on the moon and on the earth? GRAVITATION 111 2024-25 13. A ball is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 49 m/s. Calculate (i) the maximum height to which it rises, (ii) the total time it  takes to return to the surface of the earth. 14. A stone is released from the top of a tower of height 19.6 m. Calculate its final velocity just before touching the ground. 15. A stone is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 40 m/s. Taking g = 10 m/s2, find the maximum height reached by the stone. What is the net displacement and the total distance covered by the stone? 16. Calculate the force of gravitation between the earth and the Sun, given that the mass of the earth = 6 × 1024 kg and of the Sun = 2 × 1030 kg. The average distance between the two is 1.5 × 1011 m.
