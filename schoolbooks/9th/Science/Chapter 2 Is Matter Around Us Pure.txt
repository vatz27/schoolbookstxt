Chapter 2 IS MATTER AROUND US PURE? How do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter, a pure substance and cannot be separated by salt, spices, mineral water or juice that we buy physical process into its chemical constituents. from the market are pure? Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains only one kind of pure matter and its composition is the same throughout. Soft drink and soil are not single pure substances. Whatever the source of a pure substance may be, it will always have the same characteristic properties. Therefore, we can say that a mixture contains more than one pure substance. 2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES Fig. 2.1: Some consumable items Depending upon the nature of the components Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’ that form a mixture, we can have different written on the packs of these consumables? types of mixtures. For a common person pure means having no Activity ______________ 2.1 adulteration.

Such mixtures are called homogeneous kind of pure form of matter. We know that mixtures or solutions. Some other dissolved sodium chloride can be separated examples of such mixtures are: (i) salt from water by the physical process of dissolved in water and (ii) sugar evaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself dissolved in water. Compare the 2024-25 colour of the solutions of the two groups. Though both the groups have obtained copper sulphate solution but the intensity of colour of the solutions is different. This shows that a homogeneous mixture can have a variable composition. • Groups C and D have obtained mixtures, which contain physically distinct parts and have non-uniform compositions. Such mixtures are called heterogeneous mixtures.

Depending upon the amount of solute that dissolves the other component in it present in a solution, it can be called  dilute, (usually the component present in larger concentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute amount) is called the solvent. The component and concentrated are comparative terms. In of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent activity 2.2, the solution obtained by group (usually present in lesser quantity) is called A is dilute as compared to that obtained by the solute. group B.

There are various ways of expressing the concentration of a solution, but here we will 2.2.1 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION learn only three methods. In activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and (i) Mass by mass percentage of a solution B obtained different shades of solutions.

The mixture obtained by group D in activity Solution: 2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution.

This happens due to the scattering of light HAT IS A SUSPENSION? by the particles of dust and smoke in the air. Non-homogeneous systems, like those obtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which solids are dispersed in liquids, are called suspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium. Particles of a suspension are visible to the naked eye.

But, a special technique of separation known as centrifugation can be used to separate the colloidal particles. The components of a colloidal solution are the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. The solute-like component or the dispersed particles in a colloid form the dispersed phase, and the component in which the dispersed phase is suspended is known Fig. 2.4: The Tyndall effect as the dispersing medium.
